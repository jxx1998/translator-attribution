1	ACT I.	第一幕	BZL
3	Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].	弗兰西斯科守望中徘徊。贝纳陀迎面上。	BZL
8	He.	正是。	BZL
9	You come most carefully upon your hour.	你来得不早不晚，正合时候。	BZL
10	Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.	十二点打过了；去睡吧，弗兰西斯科。	BZL
15	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there? Enter Horatio and Marcellus.	好象是他们的声音了。站住！谁？霍拉旭与玛塞勒斯上。	BZL
31	Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	好，我们都坐下吧，听听贝纳陀又是怎样的说法。	BZL
38	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	象极了。真奇怪，真叫我毛骨悚然。	BZL
39	It would be spoke to.	他要我们先开口。	BZL
53	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	请坐下，谁要是知道就给我讲讲为什么我们要这样子戒备森严，这样子夜夜叫军民不得安息，为什么这样子天天铸造铜炮，这样子天天向国外购买军火，这样子征用造船匠，叫天天辛苦，就连星期日也不能算作例外。都是准备的什么，才这样忙碌，叫黑夜也同白天搭伴了做苦工？谁能告诉我是怎么一回事吗？	BZL
55	But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	从我们手里，恢复他父亲失去的那些土地；据我看来，这就是我们这样子准备的主要动机，我们这样子日夜戒备的原因。全国这样子手忙脚乱的缘故。	BZL
56	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想该就是为了这个缘故；这些战争前后都牵涉到先王，怪不得那个鬼影，活象是他，全副武装，走过了我们的岗位。	BZL
61	Tis here!	在这儿！	BZL
63	Tis gone! Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	走了！〔鬼魂下。它一举一动都这样威严，堂皇，我们不该对它这样子粗暴；它就象空气，刀枪都伤它不得，瞎砍是行不了凶，倒出了丑。	BZL
74	Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation,   Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.	敢求陛下鸿恩，准回法国；这次回丹麦参加陛下的加冕礼克尽为臣的责任，不胜荣幸：目下，为臣的敢说，任务已了，心思和意愿重新又折向法国，仅此伏求陛下开恩俯允。	BZL
76	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent. I do beseech you give him leave to go.	陛下，他苦苦哀求，舌敝唇焦，好容易挖出了我嘴里“可以”两个字，我在他决心上盖下了生硬的“同意”。他要走，就请陛下放他走吧。	BZL
77	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son- [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!	善用好时光，莱阿替斯。时间都归你，愿发挥你的美德去充分消受！得，哈姆雷特，我的侄儿，我的儿——哈〔旁白〕亲上加亲，越亲越不相亲！	BZL
83	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好象？不。我不懂什么叫“好象”。好母亲，尽管我披一件墨黑的外套，按礼从俗，满身都穿起丧服，好容易从肺腑吐出来长吁短叹，眼泪象江流滚滚、一泻千里，再加上垂头丧气，形容惟悴，再加上千种表情，万种姿态，都不能真正表现我。这真是“好象”，象如此，象这般，是人人会耍的把戏；我的心事是无法表现出来的——这一套都只是哀痛的衣服和装饰。	BZL
92	Horatio!- or I do forget myself.	可不是霍拉旭！——我差点把自己都忘了。	BZL
96	I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	我很高兴看见你。（对贝纳陀）你早啊，你好。——可是你究竟为什么离开了威登堡呢？	BZL
111	Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.	请殿下不要惊慌，且仔细听一听，我就请这二位在场的为我作证，对殿下从头至尾仔细讲一讲这一件怪事。	BZL
115	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	殿下，就是在我们守夜的平台上。	BZL
121	Arm'd, say you? Both. Arm'd, my lord.	你们说十足是全副武装吗？玛、贝十足是全副武装，殿下。	BZL
133	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  	一定的，一定的。它可是待了很久？	BZL
135	Both. Longer, longer. Not when I saw’t.	我只看见这么久。	BZL
143	Scene III. Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.	第三场 波乐纽斯家中一室。	BZL
148	No more but so?	不过如此？	BZL
155	The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.	时间在唤你。走吧，听差在等你。	BZL
157	Tis in my memory lock'd,	我把它锁在记忆里，	BZL
160	What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	莪菲丽亚，他对你说了一些什么话？	BZL
167	My lord, he hath importun'd me with love In honourable fashion.	爹爹，他对我求爱的态度十足是光明正大。	BZL
169	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	爹爹，他为了证明心迹，可说是用出了一切神圣的海誓山盟。	BZL
175	It is a nipping and an eager air.	真叫是寒风凛冽，砭人肌骨。	BZL
180	The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.	国王令晚上安排了通宵的宴饮。闹酒取乐再加上撒野跳舞，他每干一大杯莱茵酒，铜鼓和喇叭就这样大吹大擂，一致庆祝他酒战胜利。	BZL
183	Look, my lord, it comes!	殿下看，它来了！	BZL
185	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	它在对你招手，叫你跟它去，好象它心里有些什么话一定要单对你说。	BZL
189	It will not speak. Then will I follow it.	它不肯就说；我就一定跟它去。	BZL
191	Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.	为什么，有什么可怕？我把生命看得不值一枚针；至于我的灵魂，既同它自己一样是不朽的，它又能伤它什么？它又招我前去了。我就跟它去。	BZL
201	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	丹麦的国家里怕有点乌七八糟。	BZL
211	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.	不要可怜我，只要认真听我要说的事情。	BZL
215	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，判定有一个时期要夜游人世，白天就只能空肚子受火焰燃烧，直到我生前所犯的一切罪孽完全烧净了才罢。我不能犯禁，不能泄漏我狱中的任何秘密，要不然我可以讲讲，轻轻的一句话就会直穿你灵府，冻结你热血，使你的眼睛，象流星，跳出了眶子，使你纠结的发鬈鬈鬈分开，使你每一根发丝丝丝直立，就象发怒的毫猪身上的毛刺。可是这种永劫的神秘决不可透露给血肉的耳朵。听啊，听我说！如果你曾经爱过你亲爱的父亲——	BZL
216	O God!	天啊！	BZL
218	Murther?	谋杀？	BZL
219	Murther most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.	恶毒的谋杀，谋杀是最恶毒不过的，可是那一下更恶毒，更伤天害理。	BZL
224	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!	啊，可怕！啊，可怕！真可怕！	BZL
225	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	只要你有一点天性，就不要容忍；不要让堂堂的丹麦国家的御床变成了一张窝藏淫乱的卧榻。可是无论你怎样进行复仇，别玷污你的心灵，对你的母亲也不可有所不利。让她由天罚，让她受那些长到她内心的荆棘无情的刺痛吧。我们得分别了。萤火虫显出了黎明就在眼前，这些闪闪的微光已经淡了。再见，再见，再见：你要记着我。（下。	BZL
229	Heaven secure him!	天保佑殿下！	BZL
244	Bernardo?	是剖那陀？	SDY
246	You come most carefully upon your hour.	你来得好准时。	SDY
248	For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.	多谢你来接班；天冷得真厉害，我心里又挺不好受。	SDY
252	Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	好吧，明天见。你要是碰到霍瑞旭和马帅勒史，要跟我同来值岗的，叫他们赶快。	SDY
268	Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.	暂且坐下来，等我们再一回送进您的耳朵里去，它们好比是壁垒森严的城堡，拒绝听这故事，我们已一连两个夜晚见到过。	SDY
273	In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  	就是那模样，跟先王一般无二。	SDY
276	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	像得很：它使我无比的惊奇与骇怕。	SDY
277	It would be spoke to.	它要我们先开谈。	SDY
281	See, it stalks away!	看！它迈开长步要去了。	SDY
287	Is it not like the King?	它像不像先王？	SDY
293	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想该是为这个，没其他的原因；这就前后合了拍，那兆凶的形相，甲胄披着身，穿过我们的岗哨，这么像先王，原来跟战事有关。	SDY
310	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然对亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特下世去记忆犹新，我们正该当满心存悲痛，全王国上下如一人，深锁着愁眉，蹙一片广大的哀容，但周详的思虑兀自跟感情作战，于是我们以适度的悲伤想念他，同时也没有遗忘掉我们自己。所以我们仿佛以残败的欢欣——好比一只眼含着笑，一只在流泪，丧礼中有欢乐，喜庆时又唱悼歌，使欣喜和悲苦彼此铢两相称——将我们往日的嫂氏，如今的王后，我们这勇武的宗邦的袭位王嫠，娶为德配；我们在这件事情上并没有排除诸位的高见，且多承自动来赞助：对列公，我们要致谢。现在来讲小福丁勃拉思，这件事各位都知道，他小觑我们的声威，或者认为亲爱的先兄去世后，我们这邦国便变得散乱不成形，加上他自以为有利可图的妄想，他就不断送文书前来相薅恼，一意要我们放弃他父亲的邦土，那失地归我们英勇的王兄所奄有，全经受法律保障。关于他，到这里。现在来谈我们自己和这次会议。事情是这样：我们备好了一封书，给小福丁勃拉思的叔父挪威王，他衰病缠身，卧床不起，不知道他侄儿的谋划，请他把他那侄儿进一步的行动加以制止；为的是那招兵募众，聚草征粮，全部由他治下的臣民负担；我特此派你，考耐列欧斯，还有你，伏尔砥曼特，作专使，送这封文书给挪威老王，可是我授与你们对彼邦君主相应的权限，不得任意超越了这些指示所明白规定的范围。再见，望即速去奉命，以表忠诚。这使命，一切事，我们都忠心赤胆。	SDY
317	[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!	[旁白]比亲戚过了头，要说亲人还不够。	SDY
324	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	对你父亲这么样居丧而尽孝，哈姆雷特，显示你天性可爱赞；但须知你父亲也曾丧失过父亲，那父亲又曾丧失过他的；未死者理应谨守着孝道，为哀悼而悲痛一个时期；但是去坚持而不舍，固执地伤痛得无休无止，却是种不孝的顽固行径，没男儿气概：那显示一个违背天心的意志，心胸尚未经磨砺，情志太浮躁，智虑过于简单，没经受过修养。因为我们知道那势有所必至，以及理有所固然的寻常事故，为什么我们要任性使气地对抗，牢记在心头？嘿！这触犯了上天，触犯了死者，触犯了造化的法则，对理性极荒谬，揆情度理父亲死乃是寻常事，它从这世上第一回人亡故直到今朝有人死总在叫，“这定得如此”。我们切望你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，将我当作是你的父亲；因为，让举世都知悉，你是我们王位最直接的继承人；最热情的父亲爱他儿子有多么宏隆，我对你的宝爱比起他来绝不会有分毫逊色。至于你要想负笈回到威登堡去继续求学，那对我们的愿望可完全相反；极愿你，改变了心意，在这里留下，在我们和煦的目光眷顾下，温慰中，当我们的重臣，侄儿，当今的世子。	SDY
329	Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.	[霍瑞旭，马帅勒史与剖那陀上。	SDY
336	I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	见到你我很高兴。[向剖那陀]晚上好，足下。——可是你当真为什么离开威登堡？	SDY
338	I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	我不愿听你的仇家这么说你，也不能让你这般打击我这耳朵，要它相信你对你自己这么样诋毁；我知道你不是懒散的浪子。可是你到埃尔辛诺来做什么？你离开之前我们要教会你酣饮。	SDY
340	I prithee do not mock me, fellow student. I think it was to see my mother's wedding.	我请你，莫对我这般嘲笑，老同学；我想你来参加我母亲的婚礼。	SDY
344	In my mind's eye, Horatio.	在我的心眼里，霍瑞旭。	SDY
354	But where was this?	这是在哪里？	SDY
355	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	殿下，在我们警卫的那座高坛上。	SDY
362	Then saw you not his face?	那么，你们不曾见到他的脸？	SDY
367	Nay, very pale.	不红，很苍白。	SDY
386	Do you doubt that?	你不信那个吗？	SDY
387	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	关于哈姆雷特，他对你耍殷勤，把它当趋鹜时尚，调情的奇想，青春发育时期的一朵紫罗兰，早开花，早谢，很香甜，可不能经久，只供片刻间玩赏的一缕花香，只此而无他。	SDY
389	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	正是的；因为人身体成长，不光是筋肉和躯干生发；而当这神殿扩张时，心志和神魂所祈求的内心供奉，也跟着增长。他现在也许爱你，现在还没有肮脏和欺骗玷污他清纯的意向：可是，你得要戒惧，考虑到地位，他不能自己做主；因为他要受他自己身份的限制：他不能像无足轻重的人那样，自己定去取，为的是他选得恰当与否决定着全国的安危和兴废；他身居邦国之首，他妃子的征选自应先得到邦国的赞成和听从，经受到约束。那么，他若说他爱你，你该使用聪明去那般听信他，要他由地位规定他采取的行动能履行他所说的话；而这可不出丹麦宗邦整个都赞同的限度外。然后要衡量你那片贞洁将遭受什么样损失，你若太信他的歌声，或是把真心丢给他，漫无羁勒的强求和硬要会打开你童贞的宝藏。要戒惧，莪斐丽亚，要戒惧，亲妹子，你要待在你真正的意向后边，在他情欲的射程与危险之外。那翼翼小心的姑娘已经够放浪，要是她面对着月亮把芳容暴露；玉洁冰清还难逃诽谤的打击；往往在嫩蕊含苞未放的时节，毛虫就已把阳春的娇儿咬伤，当青春对旭照，在朝露泫泫之际，恶毒的风吹雨打最容易摧折它。所以要小心；最安全莫过于戒惧：没有人在旁，青春尚且会自戕。	SDY
391	Enter Polonius. 	[朴罗纽司上。	SDY
392	O, fear me not! I stay too long. But here my father comes. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.	莫替我担忧。我耽搁得太久：父亲可又来了。双重的祝福自会有再度的天恩；凑巧的机缘笑对这第二回告别。	SDY
393	Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	你还在这里，赉候底施！真羞人，上船，上船！风守在帆篷肩胛上大家在等你。就这么，我为你祝福！还有这几句教训你要去铭记在心头。想到什么不要就说出来，也不要乱想起什么就把事情做。待人要亲切不拘礼，可不得亵狎；旧有的朋友，交情曾经考验过，用钢箍将他们牢牢扣上你灵魂；但莫把每个新结的相识当知交，逢人便款待，手掌起老茧。要当心勿跟人轻易起争吵；但一开了端，便要坚持，使对方得当心对待你。多多听人家说话，少对人开言；多接受意见，自己的判断要保留。衣服讲究得尽你的钱包能负担，但不要花费富俏；要贵重，莫浮夸；一个人的衣着往往标明他品性，他们在法国，身份贵地位高的人特别在那上头最是讲究，最华贵。既不要告贷，也不要借钱给人，借给人往往丢了钱也丢了朋友，而向人借贷会挫钝节约的快口。这句话高过一切：对自己要真实，然后正好比黑夜跟着白昼来，你就不可能对任何旁人不真实。再会：愿我这番话铭记在你心中。	SDY
394	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	父亲在上，儿子谨此拜别了。	SDY
398	Farewell.Exit.	再会。[下。	SDY
399	What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	他对你说了些什么话，莪斐丽亚？	SDY
401	Marry, well bethought! 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you, and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so- as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution- I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? Give me up the truth.	凭圣处女，倒想得很不错：我听说他近来常把私下的时间和你一起过，而且你自己也总是肯听他的话，开怀爽快得不得了。要果真这样——人家这样跟我说，而那是劝我要当心——我得告诉你，你太不懂得你自己该怎样，才同做我的女儿和你的清名能相称。你们之间怎么样？对我说真话。	SDY
403	Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?	爱情！呸！你说话真像个傻丫头，全没有经历过这样危险的情势。你相信他的献出吗，如你所说的？	SDY
407	Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!	是啊，你叫它态度；算了吧，算了吧。	SDY
417	No, it is struck.	不，已经敲过。	SDY
424	Look, my lord, it comes!	看啊，殿下，它来了！	SDY
428	Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground. But do not go with it!	看，它姿势有多么温文，招手引您去比较背隐的地方：可不要跟它去。	SDY
435	You shall not go, my lord.	您不能前去，殿下。	SDY
437	Be rul'd. You shall not go.	请听话；不能去。	SDY
446	Enter Ghost and Hamlet.	鬼魂与哈姆雷特上。	SDY
449	I will.	我听。	SDY
452	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.	不用可怜我，只要认真倾听着我要说的事。	SDY
456	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的亡魂；判定了在夜间出现一个时期，白天要禁闭在火里断食悔罪，直到我生前所犯罪恶的孽迹都烧光涤净为止。要不是被禁止，不准泄漏我狱中的那些秘密，我能作一番诉叙，它最轻微的话能叫你的灵魂恼杀，热血冻结，使你的眼睛，流星般跳出眶子来，使你那纠结而梳顺的卷须分开，每一根发丝笔立直竖了起来，好像发怒的豪猪身上的针刺。可是这永劫之秘决不能宣泄给血肉的耳朵听。但听啊，呵，听啊！若是你确曾爱过你亲爱的父亲——	SDY

Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables!

520	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我可以告诉你，至少一般人都是这样传说。刚才它的形象还像我们出现的那位已故的王上，你们知道，曾经接受骄矜好胜的挪威的福丁布拉斯的挑战；在那一次决斗中间，我们的勇武的哈姆雷特——他的英名是举世称颂的——把福丁布拉斯杀死了；按照双方根据法律的武士精神所订立的协定，福丁布拉斯要是战败了，除了他自己的生命以外，必须把他所有的一切土地拨归胜利的一方；同时我们的王上也是提出相当的土地作为赌注，要是福丁布拉斯得胜了，就归他所有，正像在同一协定上所规定的，他失败了，哈姆雷特可以把他的土地没收一样。现在要说起那位福丁布拉斯的儿子，他生得一副烈火也似的性格，已经在挪威的四境召集了一群无赖之徒，供给他们衣食，驱策他们去干冒险的勾当；他的唯一目的，我们的当局看得很清楚，无非是要用武力和强迫性的条件，夺回他父亲所丧失的土地。照我所知道的，这就是我们种种准备的主要动机，我们这样戒备的唯一原因，也是全国所以这样慌忙骚乱的缘故。	ZSH
524	But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion! Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and, race to me, Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),	我要挡住它的去路，即使它会害我。不要走，鬼魂！要是你会开口，对我说话吧；要是我有可以为你效劳之处，使你的灵魂得到安息，那么对我说话吧；要是你预知祖国的命运，靠着你的指示，也许可以及时避免未来灾祸，那么对我说话吧！或者你在生前曾经把你搜刮得来的财宝埋藏在地下，我听见人家说，鬼魂往往在他们藏金的地方徘徊不散，[鸡啼]	ZSH

531	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.	它正要说话的时候，鸡就啼了。	ZSH
532	And then it started, like a guilty thing   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	于是它就像一个罪犯听到了可怕的召唤似的惊跳起来。我听人家说，报晓的雄鸡用它高锐的啼声，唤醒了白昼之神，一听到它的警告，那些在海里、火里、地下、空中到处浪游的有罪的灵魂，就一个个钻回自己的巢穴里去，这句话现在已经证实了。	ZSH
533	It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.	鬼魂在鸡鸣的时候隐去，有人说我们的救主将要诞生之前，这报晓的鸟儿彻夜长鸣；那时候，他们说，没有一个鬼魂可以出外行走，夜间的空气非常清净，没有一颗星用毒光射人，没有一个神仙用法术迷人，妖巫的符咒也失去了力量，一切都是圣洁而美好的。	ZSH

84	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样当孝子，居丧尽哀，足见你天性纯笃，大可称道，但是须知你父亲失去过父亲，那个父亲也曾失去过父亲，后死者要克尽孝道，自然要哀悼一个时期。但是漫无止境，哀毁逾恒，却正是不够孝顺的一种行径，不够堂堂男子气；这反而表现出意志是逆天背理，心是经不起磨练，性情是暴躁，头脑是十分简单，毫无修养。既然我们知道是无可避免的，而且同家常便饭一样的普通，为什么我们要赌气，老记在心上呢？咦！这种行径是违反了上天，违反了死者，违反了人情世故，最蛮不讲理，全不管丁忧丧父在理性是看作常事的，全不管理性就从第一遭变故直喊到如今：“这是不可避免的！”我请你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；我要全世界知道你是我的王位的最直接继承人；最好的慈父怎样用最大的慈爱对待儿子，我就怎样对待你，决不比他差一分。至于你想要回到威登堡大学去继续读书，这种想法是最不合我的意思的；我请你、一定要勉强你、留在这里，使满朝欣慰，当我的第一名重臣，不愧为王上的爱侄，王上的宠儿。	BZL

And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	还在这儿，莱阿替斯？上船去，上船去，真好意思！风息在帆篷的肩头上，人家在等你啊。得，我为你祝福！有几句教训你务必铭刻在心。你不要想到什么就说什么，也不要想到什么就做什么。待人要和气，但是决不要随便：相知有素的朋友，考验过交情，就该用钢圈箍上你的灵魂：可不要跟每个半生不熟的相识过分周旋，握粗了你的手掌。当心跟人家吵架，既然吵起来就做到让对手下次碰上你要当心。多听人提意见，少对人发表意见；有批评都接受，自己的判断要保留。口袋里有钱，尽管办贵重衣服，可不要奇装异服；要富丽，避俗艳；要知道穿著往往标明了人品，在法国最有身分的第一流人物特别在穿著上显得最讲究，最大方。才成了成语。不向人借钱，也并不借钱给谁；借出去往往就丢了钱也丢了朋友，借进来会叫你忘记了化钱要省。这一点高于一切——要忠于自己；就如同先有了白昼才会有黑夜。要这样才不会不忠于任何一人。再见：祝你使这番话开花结果！	BZL

522	O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!	啊，一世的英才就这样坍倒了！朝廷人士的眼睛、学者的舌头、军人的利剑、国家的期望和花朵、风流时尚的镜子、文雅的典范、举世瞩目的中心，倒了，全倒了！我呢，妇女中最伤心、悲惨的女子，从他盟誓的音乐里吸取过甜蜜，如今却看着他高贵无上的理智好象银铃儿搅乱了，失去了和谐：看着他青春年少的无比的风貌叫疯狂一下子摧折了！啊，我好昔啊，看见了昨日，偏偏又看见今朝！国王与波乐纽斯上。	BZL

541	Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee,   That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing; A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. Something too much of this I There is a play to-night before the King. One scene of it comes near the circumstance, Which I have told thee, of my father's death.   I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.	别以为我是在恭维你；因为我能指望你提拔我什么，你自己就身无长物，只有靠好精神穿衣吃饭呀？为什么要恭维穷人呢？不，让甜嘴去舐荒唐的豪华吧，让关节灵活的膝盖跪下去拍开谄媚生财的门路吧。你听清了没有？自从我亲爱的灵魂会自己选择、会鉴别人物以来，它就挑中你，打好了记号。因为你始终一贯，遭受一切而不受半点伤痛，无论受命运的打击或是照拂你都能处之泰然，同样谢谢。有福的是感情和理智相称的一种人，他们并不做命运所吹弄的笛子随她的手指唱调子。只要我看见谁不是感情的奴隶，我就要把他珍藏在心坎里，哎，心坎的心坎里，就象我珍爱你一样。这不必多说了。今晚要对着国王上演一出戏；里面有一场就同我对你讲过的我父亲死难的情形有点相似。你看见那个情节演出的时候，我请你集中全副精神来注意我的叔父。如果他隐藏的罪恶、听到了一段活，还并不露出痕迹呢，那么我们看见的准是个恶鬼，我的想象也就是乌七八糟，赛过乌尔干的作坊了。好好注意他；我自己也要把眼睛钉在他脸上，过后我们要对证观察的结果，给他下一个判断。	BZL

He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.	高音笛奏乐。哑剧开场。一国王与一王后同上，状甚亲热，相互拥抱。玉后跪地，向国王作表明心迹状。国王扶王后起立，偎王后颈。国王就花坪偃卧。王后见国王入睡，自下。一男子上，自国王头上除冕，吻冕，向国王耳中注毒药，下。王后重上，见国王身死，作哀恸状。下毒者偕三数从者重上，佯作陪王后哀悼状。从者舁尸下。下毒者向王后献礼，求爱；王后初作憎恶不愿状，终许其请。	BZL

I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me? Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again. What may this mean   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?	求众位天使和神差护佑我们！不管你是个善鬼还是个邪魔，带来天上的祥氛，或地狱的煞气，不问你存心恶毒，或用意仁慈，既然以这样可交谈的形态到来，我对你要说话：我叫你哈姆雷特，君上，父亲；丹麦王，啊，回答我！莫使我不耐困惑而爆炸；告诉我为什么你那按教规下葬的骸骨，在棺内挣破了尸衣而出；为什么那坟墓，我们眼见你安葬在里边，张开了它那沉重的大理石巨颚，又把你吐了出来。是什么意思，你这具尸体，重新全身披亮甲，又复到这月光明灭中徘徊，使黑夜吓人；使我们，造化的玩物，心神震颤得有如那瑟瑟的摇旌，缭乱着魂梦所不敢沾的荒沧怪想？你说，为什么？因什么？我们该怎样？	SDY

865	Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency. That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.	当真，不会的；只要你说得轻飘些。你可不能进一步加污辱于他了，说他好色贪淫；我并不要那样：要把他的过失说得空泛而轻淡，好叫它们看来像倜傥的污斑，心神精力弥漫时的一阵爆发，方刚的血气在那里越规撒野，年轻人惯常容易犯。	SDY
868	Ay, my lord, I would know that.	是的，大人，我想要知道。	SDY

889	He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so. At last, a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn'd He seem'd to find his way without his eyes, For out o' doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me.	他拉住我的臂腕，握得我紧紧的，然后往后退，把手臂尽量伸直；再把还有那只手盖住在额上他开始瞅着我的脸细细端详，好比要画像。他这样呆了很久；最后，将我的臂膀轻轻抖一下，他的头这么上下晃动了几回，他发出一声长叹恁可怜而沉痛，好像要使他的身躯爆炸破裂，结果掉生命；然后他放了我的手；他把头扭过来回向肩后凝望，似乎觅路出门去没有用眼睛；因为他步出了房门全不加顾视，一直到最后还是目注着对我看。	SDY
890	Come, go with me. I will go seek the King. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself   And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late?	来吧，跟我一起去：我要去找王上。这正是爱情不顺当害的花痴，它那猛烈的性质毁坏了自己，将意志引向不顾一切的行径，往往跟天下任何种激情一个样，叫我们的心性遭荼毒。我很抱憾。怎么，你最近对他有难堪的话吗？	SDY
896	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance.	亲爱的士子们，他总是说起你们，我深信这世上再没有另外两个人比两君同他更亲密。你们若高兴对我们表示这么多礼让和善意，答允和我们一起稍花些时日，为资助以及裨益于我们的希望，你们的莅临定将有不愧为君王所铭记在心的感谢。	SDY
912	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper.	他告我，亲爱的葛忒露，他已经找到了你儿子神思错乱的因由。	SDY
920	Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure! But farewell it, for I will use no art.   Mad let us grant him then. And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect- Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause. Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter (have while she is mine), Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.the letter. 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'- That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus:'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'	娘娘，我发誓一点没有转花腔。他是发了疯，真的：真是可惜；又可惜是真的：多傻的修辞文饰；傻话再会了，因为我不要转花腔。那就承认他疯了吧：现在问题是我们要找出这个结果的原因，或者不如说，这个毛病的原因，因为这有病的结果总有个原因：问题就在此，剩下的问题是这样。请考虑。我有个女儿——有，当她还属于我——她对我还是尽名分，肯听从，请听，给了我这个：现在请推论，请推测。[读信]“致天仙，我灵魂的偶像，绝顶美艳的莪斐丽亚，”——那是句拙劣的语句，糟糕的语句；“美艳”这说法糟糕；可是你们请听吧。这样：[读信]“愿这几行留在她洁白的怀中，”等等。	SDY
923	O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, HAMLET.' This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.	啊亲爱的莪斐丽亚，我是不善于做诗的；我没有本领把呻吟做成诗；可是我最最爱你，啊，最最好的人儿，你要相信。再见。永远是你的，最亲爱的小姐，只要这身躯还属于他，哈姆雷特。”我女儿听从我，给我看了这柬帖，且不光如此，还把他求爱的情形，时间，地点，连同接触的机会，都一一告诉我。	SDY
927	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,   When I had seen this hot love on the wing (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me), what might you, Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think, If I had play'd the desk or table book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look'd upon this love with idle sight? What might you think? No, I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. 	我乐于确实是这样。您怎样想法，要是我眼见这火热的眷恋在上劲——我早就看到了这个，我得告诉您，还在我女儿禀报我之前——您陛下，或是亲爱的娘娘陛下，怎么想，要是我居间替他们传递书信，或者闭着我的心眼，装聋作哑，或者旁观着，懒洋洋不当一回事；你们会觉得怎样？我马上采取了行动，对我家小姑娘这样说道：“殿下乃是位亲王，你高攀不上；这件事可不行”：然后我对她吩咐，要对他的通问和见面闭门不纳，不接见来使，不收受礼品和信物。我说后她照我这番教谕去行事，而他遭到了摈拒之后，简单说，就变得抑郁不欢，食物也不进，继而夜间不入睡，身体变虚弱，继而便神思恍惚，一步步败坏，直到发了疯，如今便胡言乱语，叫我们大家都悲痛。	SDY
942	Do you know me, my lord?	您认识我吗，殿下？	SDY
946	Honest, my lord?	老实，殿下？	SDY
947	Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man pick'd out of ten thousand.	是啊，卿家；要老实，拿这世界来说，是一万人中只挑得出一个来。	SDY
949	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god   kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?	因为要是太阳在一条死狗身上生得出蛆，那是块好给亲嘴的臭肉——你有个女儿吗？	SDY
955	Between who?	谁跟谁讲？	SDY
965	My honour'd lord!	尊贵的殿下！	SDY
984	O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.	上帝在上，我可以关在个核桃壳里，而还把自己当作个无限空间之王，只要我不做那些个噩梦。	SDY
989	We'll wait upon you.	我们来侍候您。	SDY
992	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you; and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.	我是个穷花子，穷得连谢谢都拿不出来；可是我谢谢你们了：而当然，朋友们，我的这声谢谢还不值半个便士。你们不是被召请来的吗？是出于你们的本意吗？是自动来的吗？来，老实对待我：来，来；别那么，说呀。	SDY
994	Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.	哎也，不论什么，只要中肯。你们是被召请来的；你们的神情就在承认这个，你们的羞惭没有足够的机巧把它掩饰掉：我知道亲爱的王上和王后召请了你们来。	SDY
1011	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither.	不是，他们使的功夫和往常一样；可是，殿下，如今有一窠雏鹰般的孩子，没训练好的小鹰鹞，尖着嗓门高叫，博得了台下吓死人的喝彩；现下要算这些入时当令，他们把普通的戏台——大家这样称呼它们——嚷嚷得闹翻了天，以致好多佩剑的士子怕被文人们所嘲笑，不敢去光顾成人班了。	SDY
1017	It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.	这倒不很奇怪；因为，我叔父如今是丹麦王上，当年我父王在世时会对他做鬼脸的人，现在愿出二十、四十、五十、一百块大洋来买他的一枚小肖像了。天知道，这里头是有些反常的道理的，要是哲学家能发现出来的话。	SDY
1019	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.	两位士子，欢迎你们到埃尔辛诺来。那就握手，来吧：欢迎总含有礼节和仪式，让我在这形式上尽礼吧，否则我对伶人们的行止[那个，我对你们说，在外表上一定要显得殷勤和蔼]会看来比对你们的更亲切好客了。你们是受欢迎的：可是我的叔父父亲和婶母母亲是弄错了。	SDY
1021	I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.	我只疯到了西北偏正北：风从南面吹来时，我还分辨得出苍鹰跟苍鹭。	SDY
1030	Upon my honour-	凭我的荣誉——	SDY
1031	Then came each actor on his ass-	那么，他们每人骑着头驴子来。	SDY
1035	Why,'One fair daughter, and no more,The which he loved passing well.'	哎也，“只一个绝色的闺女，他爱她可真了不得。”	SDY
1036	Still on my daughter.	还是在讲我的女儿。	SDY
1039	Nay, that follows not.	不对，那倒不一定。	SDY
1044	Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.	当着上帝说，殿下，您讲得真不错，音调高低也好，思虑也周到。	SDY
1046	It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on. He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.	把它跟你的髭须一同送到剃头铺里去。请再讲下去：他爱的是滑稽歌舞或淫秽的故事，否则他会打瞌睡；讲下去；讲到海居白。	SDY

1076	With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights.	我很乐意去；听到他高兴这么样，我颇为满意。亲爱的士子们，再提高他的兴致，鼓起他的意向往这些欢娱上去。	SDY
1080	Madam, I wish it may.	娘娘，但愿能如此。	SDY
1081	Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book, That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this, 'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er   The Devil himself.	莪斐丽亚，你在此闲步着。尊上，请吧，我们就躲起来。[向莪斐丽亚]念着这本书；要使你这番用功掩盖你为何独自在此。我们在这上头常被责——且证明不错——说是用虔诚的外表和圣洁的行动，我们装饰着内里那魔鬼的真身。	SDY
1088	No, not I! I never gave you aught.	不行，我不收；我从未送过你什么。	SDY
1094	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.	我是说，你假使又贞洁又美丽，你的贞洁可不该跟你的美丽有亲密的交往。	SDY
1095	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?	殿下，美丽能有比贞洁更好的对手相与交往吗？	SDY
1106	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your   wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. 	我也听说你们好搽脂抹粉，听够了；上帝给了你们一张脸，你们自己又另外做一张：你们像在演滑稽歌舞，扭捏作态，娇声媚气，替上帝造的众生起上些个绰号，而且装出一副天真烂漫的外貌掩盖着里边的淫荡。得了吧，我不想再多讲了；我已经给气得发疯。我说，我们不能再允许结婚了：那些已经结了婚的，全都能活着，只除了一个；其余还没有结婚的，只许跟目前一样。进个修道院去，去吧。	SDY
1107	O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!	啊，多高贵的一注才华毁掉了！朝士的丰标器宇，学士的舌辩，武士的霜锋；宗邦的指望与英华，都雅风流的明镜，礼让的典范，万众的钦仰之宗，全倒，全毁了！而我，女娘中最伤心、悲惨的姐妹，从他信誓的音乐里吮吸过蜜露，如今却眼见他恢弘卓绝的聪明像甜蜜的钟声暗哑戛轹不成调；花一般盛放的青春的无比风貌被疯狂吹折了：啊，我好苦痛哟，看见了往常所见的，还见到今朝！	SDY
1117	O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go   make you ready.	啊，要完全改掉它。而且让那些演小丑的除了脚本上替他们写下的话之外不要多讲：因为他们有的人会自己笑起来，叫一部分没脑筋的听众也哄笑，虽然正在这时候戏里有些必要的问题得考虑：那真讨厌，显得这乱来的小丑抱着最可鄙的野心。去，你们做好准备吧。	SDY
1118	How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?	怎么样，卿家？君王会来听这出戏吗？	SDY
1125	O, my dear lord!	啊，亲爱的殿下，——	SDY
1128	They are coming to the play. I must be idle.   Get you a place.	他们来看戏了；我得要装出疯癫：你另找个地方去坐。	SDY
1141	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?	小娘，我躺在你怀抱里头好吗？	SDY
1144	Ay, my lord.	好的，殿下。	SDY

1150	You are merry, my lord.	您在开玩笑，殿下。	SDY
1151	Who, I?	谁，我？	SDY
1156	Hautboys play. The dumb show enters. Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love.	一君王携后妃上，状甚眷昵；两人相互拥抱。后跪地，向王作倾吐衷肠状。王挽起之，偎伊颈项间；旋偃卧花坡上；伊见其入睡，即引退。俄有男子上，取王冠，吻之，注毒药于寝君耳内而下。后返，见王已死，作恸哭状。下毒者率两三人重上，似与后同作悼哭状。王尸被舁去。下毒者向后赠礼求爱；伊始若不愿，但终纳其爱。]	SDY
1161	Will he tell us what this show meant?	他会告诉我们这场表演是什么意思吗？	SDY
1162	Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.	是啊，或是你会表演给他看的不拘什么表演；只要你不害臊表演得出来，他就不怕羞能讲给你听那是什么意思。	SDY

1174	Bernardo?	勃那多吗？	ZSH
1176	You come most carefully upon your hour.	你来得很准时。	ZSH
1208	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!	你是什么鬼怪，胆敢僭窃丹麦先王神武的雄姿，在这样深夜的时分出现？凭着上天的名义，我命令你说话！	ZSH
1215	Is it not like the King?	它不像我们的国王吗？	ZSH
1216	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正像你就是你自己一样。它身上的那副战铠，正是他讨伐野心的挪威王的时候所穿的；它脸上的那副怒容，活像他有一次和敌人谈判决裂以后，把那些乘雪车的波兰人打倒在冰上的时候的神气，怪事怪事！	ZSH
1221	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想正是为了这个缘故。我们那位王上在过去和目前的战乱中间，都是一个主要的角色，所以无怪他以武装的形象要向我们出现示警了。	ZSH
1226	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?	要不要用我的戟刺它？	ZSH
1229	Tis here! Exit Ghost.	它在这儿！[鬼魂下]	ZSH
1230	We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	它走了！我们不该用暴力对待这样一个尊严的亡魂；因为它是像空气一样不可侵害的。我们无益的打击不过是恶意的徒劳。	ZSH
1240	We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell. Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.	我相信你们的忠心；再会！[伏提曼德考尼律斯同下]	ZSH
1242	My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation,   Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.	陛下，我要请求您允许我回到法国去；这一次我回国参加陛下加冕的盛典，略尽臣子的微忱，实在是莫大的荣幸；可是现在我的任务已尽，我的心愿又向法国飞驰，但求陛下开恩允准。	ZSH

1254	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样孝思不匮，原是你天性中纯笃过人之处；可是你要知道，你的父亲也曾失去过一个父亲，那失去的父亲自己也失去过父亲；那后死的儿子为了尽他的孝道，必须有一个时期服丧守制，然而固执不变的哀伤，却是一种逆天悖理的愚行，不是堂堂男子所应有的举动；它表现出一个不肯安于天命的意志，一个经不起艰难痛苦的心，一个缺少忍耐的头脑和一个简单愚昧的理性。既然我们知道那是无可避免的事，无论谁都要遭遇到同样的经验，那么我们为什么要这样固执地把它介意于怀呢？嘿！那是对上天的罪戾，对死者的罪戾，也是违反人情的罪戾；在理智上它是完全荒谬的，因为从第一个死了的父亲起，直到今天死去的最后一个父亲为止，理智永远在呼喊：“这是无可避免的。”我请你抛弃了这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；因为我要让全世界知道，你是王位直接的继承者，我要给你尊荣和恩宠，不亚于一个最慈爱的父亲之于他的儿子。至于你要回到维滕贝格去继续求学的意思，那是完全违反我们的愿望的；请你听从我的劝告，不要离开这里，在朝廷上领袖群臣，做我们最亲近的国亲和王子，使我们因为每天能够看见你而感到欢欣。	ZSH
1255	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	不要让你母亲的祈求全归无用，哈姆雷特；请你不要离开我们，不要到维滕贝格去。	ZSH
1257	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	啊，那才是一句有孝心的答复；你将在丹麦享有和我同等的尊荣。御妻，来。哈姆雷特这一种自动的顺从使我非常高兴；为了表示庆祝，今天丹麦王每一次举杯祝饮的时候，都要放一响高入云霄的祝炮，让上天应和着地上的雷鸣，发出欢乐的回声。来。[除哈姆雷特外均下]	ZSH
1277	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	殿下，我想我昨天晚上看见他了。	ZSH
1286	Did you not speak to it?	你们有没有和它说话？	ZSH
1295	Both. My lord, from head to foot.	从头到脚，殿下。	ZSH
1296	Then saw you not his face?	那么你们没有看见它的脸吗？	ZSH
1297	O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.	啊，看见的，殿下；它的脸角是掀起的。	ZSH

1344	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	而且，父亲，他差不多用尽一切指天誓日的神圣的盟约，证实他的言语。	ZSH
1350	It is a nipping and an eager air.	是很凛冽的寒风。	ZSH
1353	No, it is struck.	不，已经打过了。	ZSH
1362	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	它招手叫您跟着它去，好像它有什么话要对您一个人说似的。	ZSH
1367	Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.	嘿，怕什么呢？我把我的生命看得不值一枚针；至于我的灵魂，那是跟它自己同样永生不灭的，它能够加害它吗？它又在招手叫我前去了；我要跟它去。	ZSH
1371	Hold off your hands!	放开你们的手！	ZSH
1375	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!- I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.	凭着上天起誓，谁要是拉住我，我要叫他变成一个鬼！走开！去吧，我跟着你。[鬼魂及哈姆雷特同下]	ZSH

1392	What?	什么？	ZSH
1395	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.	你必须替他报复那逆伦惨恶的杀身的仇恨。	ZSH
1398	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.	赶快告诉我，让我驾着像思想和爱情一样迅速的翅膀，飞去把仇人杀死。	ZSH

1421	Why, right! You are in the right! And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part; You, as your business and desires shall point you, For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is; and for my own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.	啊，对了，你说得有理；所以，我们还是不必多说废话，大家握握手分开了吧。你们可以去照你们自己的意思干你们自己的事——因为各人都有各人的意思和各人的事——至于我自己，那么我对你们说，我是要祈祷去的。	ZSH
1464	But, my good lord-	可是老爷——	ZSH
1467	Marry, sir, here's my drift, And I believe it is a fetch of warrant. You laying these slight sullies on my son As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd He closes with you in this consequence: 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'- According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country-	呃，我的用意是这样的，我相信这里自有巧妙之处；你这样轻描淡写地说了我儿子的一些坏话，就像你提起一件略有污损的东西似的，听着，要是跟你谈话的那个人，也就是你向他探询的那个人，果然看见过你所说起的那个少年犯了你刚才所列举的那些罪恶，他一定会用这样的话对你表示同意：“好先生——”也许他称你“朋友”“仁兄”，按照各人的身份和各国的习惯。	ZSH

1493	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it, Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from th' understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both That, being of so young clays brought up with him, And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time; so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean,   Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That, open'd, lies within our remedy.	欢迎，亲爱的罗森格兰兹和吉尔登斯吞！这次匆匆召请你们两位前来，一方面是因为我非常思念你们，一方面也是因为我有需要你们帮忙的地方。你们大概已经听到哈姆雷特的变化；我把它称为变化，因为无论在外表上或是精神上，他已经和从前大不相同。除了他父亲的死以外，究竟还有些什么原因，把他激成了这种疯疯癫癫的样子，我实在无从猜测。你们从小便跟他在一起长大，素来知道他的脾气，所以我特地请你们到我们宫廷里来盘桓几天，陪伴陪伴他，替他解解愁闷，同时乘机窥探他究竟有些什么秘密的心事，为我们所不知道的，也许一旦公开之后，我们就可以替他对症下药。	ZSH
1496	But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.	我们愿意投身在两位陛下的足下，两位陛下无论有什么命令，我们都愿意尽力奉行。	ZSH
1500	Ay, amen! Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some Attendants].	阿门！[吉尔登斯吞及若干侍从下]	ZSH
1503	Thou still hast been the father of good news.	你总是带着好消息来报告我们。	ZSH
1504	Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king; And I do think- or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath us'd to do- that I have found   The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.	真的吗，陛下？不瞒陛下说，我把我对于我的上帝和我的宽仁厚德的王上的责任，看得跟我的灵魂一样重呢。要是我的脑筋还没有出毛病，没有想到了岔路上去，那么我想我已经发现了哈姆雷特发疯的原因。	ZSH
1507	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. [Exit Polonius.]	那么有劳你去迎接他们进来。[波洛尼厄斯下]	ZSH
1512	Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,   But better look'd into, he truly found It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd, That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack; With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.	他叫我们向陛下转达他的友好的问候。他听到了我们的要求，就立刻传谕他的侄儿停止征兵；本来他以为这种举动是准备对付波兰人的，可是一经调查，才知道它的对象原来是陛下；他知道此事以后，痛心自己因为年老多病，受人欺罔，震怒之下，传令把福丁布拉斯逮捕；福丁布拉斯并未反抗，受到了挪威王一番申斥，最后就在他的叔父面前立誓决不兴兵侵犯陛下。老王看见他诚心悔过，非常欢喜，当下就给他三千克朗的年俸，并且委任他统率他所征募的那些兵士，去向波兰人征伐；同时他叫我把这封信呈上陛下,请求陛下允许他的军队借道通过陛下的领土，他已经在信里提出若干条件，保证决不扰乱地方的安宁。 	ZSH

1562	You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my life,	先生，那是再好没有的事；但愿我也能够向我的生命告别，但愿我也能够向我的生命告别，但愿我也能够向我的生命告别。	ZSH
1565	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.	你们要找哈姆雷特殿下，那儿就是。	ZSH

1634	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene   individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.	他们是全世界最好的伶人，无论悲剧、喜剧、历史剧、田园剧、田园喜剧、田园史剧、历史悲剧、历史田园悲喜剧、不分场的古典剧或是近代的自由诗剧，他们无不拿手；塞内加的悲剧不嫌其太沉重，普劳图斯的喜剧不嫌其太轻浮。无论在规则演出还是即兴演出方面，他们都是绝无仅有的演员。	ZSH

1641	Nay, that follows not.	不，下面不是这样的。	ZSH

1698	[aside] O, 'tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word. O heavy burthen!	[旁白]啊，这句话是太真实了！它在我的良心上抽了多么重的一鞭！涂脂抹粉的娼妇的脸，还不及掩藏在虚伪的言辞后面的我的行为更丑恶。难堪的重负啊！	ZSH

"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.     Exit Servant. Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.

Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. There's no such thing: It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd Murther, Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it.
