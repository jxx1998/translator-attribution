1	ACT I.	第一幕	BZL
3	Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].	弗兰西斯科守望中徘徊。贝纳陀迎面上。	BZL
8	He.	正是。	BZL
9	You come most carefully upon your hour.	你来得不早不晚，正合时候。	BZL
10	Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.	十二点打过了；去睡吧，弗兰西斯科。	BZL
15	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there? Enter Horatio and Marcellus.	好象是他们的声音了。站住！谁？霍拉旭与玛塞勒斯上。	BZL
31	Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	好，我们都坐下吧，听听贝纳陀又是怎样的说法。	BZL
38	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	象极了。真奇怪，真叫我毛骨悚然。	BZL
39	It would be spoke to.	他要我们先开口。	BZL
53	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	请坐下，谁要是知道就给我讲讲为什么我们要这样子戒备森严，这样子夜夜叫军民不得安息，为什么这样子天天铸造铜炮，这样子天天向国外购买军火，这样子征用造船匠，叫天天辛苦，就连星期日也不能算作例外。都是准备的什么，才这样忙碌，叫黑夜也同白天搭伴了做苦工？谁能告诉我是怎么一回事吗？	BZL
55	But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	从我们手里，恢复他父亲失去的那些土地；据我看来，这就是我们这样子准备的主要动机，我们这样子日夜戒备的原因。全国这样子手忙脚乱的缘故。	BZL
56	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想该就是为了这个缘故；这些战争前后都牵涉到先王，怪不得那个鬼影，活象是他，全副武装，走过了我们的岗位。	BZL
61	Tis here!	在这儿！	BZL
63	Tis gone! Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	走了！〔鬼魂下。它一举一动都这样威严，堂皇，我们不该对它这样子粗暴；它就象空气，刀枪都伤它不得，瞎砍是行不了凶，倒出了丑。	BZL
74	Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation,   Yet now I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.	敢求陛下鸿恩，准回法国；这次回丹麦参加陛下的加冕礼克尽为臣的责任，不胜荣幸：目下，为臣的敢说，任务已了，心思和意愿重新又折向法国，仅此伏求陛下开恩俯允。	BZL
76	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent. I do beseech you give him leave to go.	陛下，他苦苦哀求，舌敝唇焦，好容易挖出了我嘴里“可以”两个字，我在他决心上盖下了生硬的“同意”。他要走，就请陛下放他走吧。	BZL
77	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son- [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!	善用好时光，莱阿替斯。时间都归你，愿发挥你的美德去充分消受！得，哈姆雷特，我的侄儿，我的儿——哈〔旁白〕亲上加亲，越亲越不相亲！	BZL
83	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好象？不。我不懂什么叫“好象”。好母亲，尽管我披一件墨黑的外套，按礼从俗，满身都穿起丧服，好容易从肺腑吐出来长吁短叹，眼泪象江流滚滚、一泻千里，再加上垂头丧气，形容惟悴，再加上千种表情，万种姿态，都不能真正表现我。这真是“好象”，象如此，象这般，是人人会耍的把戏；我的心事是无法表现出来的——这一套都只是哀痛的衣服和装饰。	BZL
92	Horatio!- or I do forget myself.	可不是霍拉旭！——我差点把自己都忘了。	BZL
96	I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	我很高兴看见你。（对贝纳陀）你早啊，你好。——可是你究竟为什么离开了威登堡呢？	BZL
111	Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.	请殿下不要惊慌，且仔细听一听，我就请这二位在场的为我作证，对殿下从头至尾仔细讲一讲这一件怪事。	BZL
115	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	殿下，就是在我们守夜的平台上。	BZL
121	Arm'd, say you? Both. Arm'd, my lord.	你们说十足是全副武装吗？玛、贝十足是全副武装，殿下。	BZL
133	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  	一定的，一定的。它可是待了很久？	BZL
135	Both. Longer, longer. Not when I saw’t.	我只看见这么久。	BZL
143	Scene III. Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.	第三场 波乐纽斯家中一室。	BZL
148	No more but so?	不过如此？	BZL
155	The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.	时间在唤你。走吧，听差在等你。	BZL
157	Tis in my memory lock'd,	我把它锁在记忆里，	BZL
160	What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	莪菲丽亚，他对你说了一些什么话？	BZL
167	My lord, he hath importun'd me with love In honourable fashion.	爹爹，他对我求爱的态度十足是光明正大。	BZL
169	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	爹爹，他为了证明心迹，可说是用出了一切神圣的海誓山盟。	BZL
175	It is a nipping and an eager air.	真叫是寒风凛冽，砭人肌骨。	BZL
180	The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.	国王令晚上安排了通宵的宴饮。闹酒取乐再加上撒野跳舞，他每干一大杯莱茵酒，铜鼓和喇叭就这样大吹大擂，一致庆祝他酒战胜利。	BZL
183	Look, my lord, it comes!	殿下看，它来了！	BZL
185	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	它在对你招手，叫你跟它去，好象它心里有些什么话一定要单对你说。	BZL
189	It will not speak. Then will I follow it.	它不肯就说；我就一定跟它去。	BZL
191	Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.	为什么，有什么可怕？我把生命看得不值一枚针；至于我的灵魂，既同它自己一样是不朽的，它又能伤它什么？它又招我前去了。我就跟它去。	BZL
201	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	丹麦的国家里怕有点乌七八糟。	BZL
211	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.	不要可怜我，只要认真听我要说的事情。	BZL
215	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，判定有一个时期要夜游人世，白天就只能空肚子受火焰燃烧，直到我生前所犯的一切罪孽完全烧净了才罢。我不能犯禁，不能泄漏我狱中的任何秘密，要不然我可以讲讲，轻轻的一句话就会直穿你灵府，冻结你热血，使你的眼睛，象流星，跳出了眶子，使你纠结的发鬈鬈鬈分开，使你每一根发丝丝丝直立，就象发怒的毫猪身上的毛刺。可是这种永劫的神秘决不可透露给血肉的耳朵。听啊，听我说！如果你曾经爱过你亲爱的父亲——	BZL
216	O God!	天啊！	BZL
218	Murther?	谋杀？	BZL
219	Murther most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.	恶毒的谋杀，谋杀是最恶毒不过的，可是那一下更恶毒，更伤天害理。	BZL
224	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!	啊，可怕！啊，可怕！真可怕！	BZL
225	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	只要你有一点天性，就不要容忍；不要让堂堂的丹麦国家的御床变成了一张窝藏淫乱的卧榻。可是无论你怎样进行复仇，别玷污你的心灵，对你的母亲也不可有所不利。让她由天罚，让她受那些长到她内心的荆棘无情的刺痛吧。我们得分别了。萤火虫显出了黎明就在眼前，这些闪闪的微光已经淡了。再见，再见，再见：你要记着我。（下。	BZL
229	Heaven secure him!	天保佑殿下！	BZL
244	Bernardo?	是剖那陀？	SDY
246	You come most carefully upon your hour.	你来得好准时。	SDY
248	For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.	多谢你来接班；天冷得真厉害，我心里又挺不好受。	SDY
252	Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	好吧，明天见。你要是碰到霍瑞旭和马帅勒史，要跟我同来值岗的，叫他们赶快。	SDY
268	Sit down awhile, And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we two nights have seen.	暂且坐下来，等我们再一回送进您的耳朵里去，它们好比是壁垒森严的城堡，拒绝听这故事，我们已一连两个夜晚见到过。	SDY
273	In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  	就是那模样，跟先王一般无二。	SDY
276	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	像得很：它使我无比的惊奇与骇怕。	SDY
277	It would be spoke to.	它要我们先开谈。	SDY
281	See, it stalks away!	看！它迈开长步要去了。	SDY
287	Is it not like the King?	它像不像先王？	SDY
293	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想该是为这个，没其他的原因；这就前后合了拍，那兆凶的形相，甲胄披着身，穿过我们的岗哨，这么像先王，原来跟战事有关。	SDY
310	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然对亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特下世去记忆犹新，我们正该当满心存悲痛，全王国上下如一人，深锁着愁眉，蹙一片广大的哀容，但周详的思虑兀自跟感情作战，于是我们以适度的悲伤想念他，同时也没有遗忘掉我们自己。所以我们仿佛以残败的欢欣——好比一只眼含着笑，一只在流泪，丧礼中有欢乐，喜庆时又唱悼歌，使欣喜和悲苦彼此铢两相称——将我们往日的嫂氏，如今的王后，我们这勇武的宗邦的袭位王嫠，娶为德配；我们在这件事情上并没有排除诸位的高见，且多承自动来赞助：对列公，我们要致谢。现在来讲小福丁勃拉思，这件事各位都知道，他小觑我们的声威，或者认为亲爱的先兄去世后，我们这邦国便变得散乱不成形，加上他自以为有利可图的妄想，他就不断送文书前来相薅恼，一意要我们放弃他父亲的邦土，那失地归我们英勇的王兄所奄有，全经受法律保障。关于他，到这里。现在来谈我们自己和这次会议。事情是这样：我们备好了一封书，给小福丁勃拉思的叔父挪威王，他衰病缠身，卧床不起，不知道他侄儿的谋划，请他把他那侄儿进一步的行动加以制止；为的是那招兵募众，聚草征粮，全部由他治下的臣民负担；我特此派你，考耐列欧斯，还有你，伏尔砥曼特，作专使，送这封文书给挪威老王，可是我授与你们对彼邦君主相应的权限，不得任意超越了这些指示所明白规定的范围。再见，望即速去奉命，以表忠诚。这使命，一切事，我们都忠心赤胆。	SDY
317	[aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!	[旁白]比亲戚过了头，要说亲人还不够。	SDY
324	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	对你父亲这么样居丧而尽孝，哈姆雷特，显示你天性可爱赞；但须知你父亲也曾丧失过父亲，那父亲又曾丧失过他的；未死者理应谨守着孝道，为哀悼而悲痛一个时期；但是去坚持而不舍，固执地伤痛得无休无止，却是种不孝的顽固行径，没男儿气概：那显示一个违背天心的意志，心胸尚未经磨砺，情志太浮躁，智虑过于简单，没经受过修养。因为我们知道那势有所必至，以及理有所固然的寻常事故，为什么我们要任性使气地对抗，牢记在心头？嘿！这触犯了上天，触犯了死者，触犯了造化的法则，对理性极荒谬，揆情度理父亲死乃是寻常事，它从这世上第一回人亡故直到今朝有人死总在叫，“这定得如此”。我们切望你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，将我当作是你的父亲；因为，让举世都知悉，你是我们王位最直接的继承人；最热情的父亲爱他儿子有多么宏隆，我对你的宝爱比起他来绝不会有分毫逊色。至于你要想负笈回到威登堡去继续求学，那对我们的愿望可完全相反；极愿你，改变了心意，在这里留下，在我们和煦的目光眷顾下，温慰中，当我们的重臣，侄儿，当今的世子。	SDY
329	Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.	[霍瑞旭，马帅勒史与剖那陀上。	SDY
336	I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	见到你我很高兴。[向剖那陀]晚上好，足下。——可是你当真为什么离开威登堡？	SDY
338	I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	我不愿听你的仇家这么说你，也不能让你这般打击我这耳朵，要它相信你对你自己这么样诋毁；我知道你不是懒散的浪子。可是你到埃尔辛诺来做什么？你离开之前我们要教会你酣饮。	SDY
340	I prithee do not mock me, fellow student. I think it was to see my mother's wedding.	我请你，莫对我这般嘲笑，老同学；我想你来参加我母亲的婚礼。	SDY
344	In my mind's eye, Horatio.	在我的心眼里，霍瑞旭。	SDY
354	But where was this?	这是在哪里？	SDY
355	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	殿下，在我们警卫的那座高坛上。	SDY
362	Then saw you not his face?	那么，你们不曾见到他的脸？	SDY
367	Nay, very pale.	不红，很苍白。	SDY
386	Do you doubt that?	你不信那个吗？	SDY
387	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	关于哈姆雷特，他对你耍殷勤，把它当趋鹜时尚，调情的奇想，青春发育时期的一朵紫罗兰，早开花，早谢，很香甜，可不能经久，只供片刻间玩赏的一缕花香，只此而无他。	SDY
389	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	正是的；因为人身体成长，不光是筋肉和躯干生发；而当这神殿扩张时，心志和神魂所祈求的内心供奉，也跟着增长。他现在也许爱你，现在还没有肮脏和欺骗玷污他清纯的意向：可是，你得要戒惧，考虑到地位，他不能自己做主；因为他要受他自己身份的限制：他不能像无足轻重的人那样，自己定去取，为的是他选得恰当与否决定着全国的安危和兴废；他身居邦国之首，他妃子的征选自应先得到邦国的赞成和听从，经受到约束。那么，他若说他爱你，你该使用聪明去那般听信他，要他由地位规定他采取的行动能履行他所说的话；而这可不出丹麦宗邦整个都赞同的限度外。然后要衡量你那片贞洁将遭受什么样损失，你若太信他的歌声，或是把真心丢给他，漫无羁勒的强求和硬要会打开你童贞的宝藏。要戒惧，莪斐丽亚，要戒惧，亲妹子，你要待在你真正的意向后边，在他情欲的射程与危险之外。那翼翼小心的姑娘已经够放浪，要是她面对着月亮把芳容暴露；玉洁冰清还难逃诽谤的打击；往往在嫩蕊含苞未放的时节，毛虫就已把阳春的娇儿咬伤，当青春对旭照，在朝露泫泫之际，恶毒的风吹雨打最容易摧折它。所以要小心；最安全莫过于戒惧：没有人在旁，青春尚且会自戕。	SDY
391	Enter Polonius. 	[朴罗纽司上。	SDY
392	O, fear me not! I stay too long. But here my father comes. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.	莫替我担忧。我耽搁得太久：父亲可又来了。双重的祝福自会有再度的天恩；凑巧的机缘笑对这第二回告别。	SDY
393	Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	你还在这里，赉候底施！真羞人，上船，上船！风守在帆篷肩胛上大家在等你。就这么，我为你祝福！还有这几句教训你要去铭记在心头。想到什么不要就说出来，也不要乱想起什么就把事情做。待人要亲切不拘礼，可不得亵狎；旧有的朋友，交情曾经考验过，用钢箍将他们牢牢扣上你灵魂；但莫把每个新结的相识当知交，逢人便款待，手掌起老茧。要当心勿跟人轻易起争吵；但一开了端，便要坚持，使对方得当心对待你。多多听人家说话，少对人开言；多接受意见，自己的判断要保留。衣服讲究得尽你的钱包能负担，但不要花费富俏；要贵重，莫浮夸；一个人的衣着往往标明他品性，他们在法国，身份贵地位高的人特别在那上头最是讲究，最华贵。既不要告贷，也不要借钱给人，借给人往往丢了钱也丢了朋友，而向人借贷会挫钝节约的快口。这句话高过一切：对自己要真实，然后正好比黑夜跟着白昼来，你就不可能对任何旁人不真实。再会：愿我这番话铭记在你心中。	SDY
394	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	父亲在上，儿子谨此拜别了。	SDY
398	Farewell.Exit.	再会。[下。	SDY
399	What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	他对你说了些什么话，莪斐丽亚？	SDY
401	Marry, well bethought! 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you, and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous. If it be so- as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution- I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? Give me up the truth.	凭圣处女，倒想得很不错：我听说他近来常把私下的时间和你一起过，而且你自己也总是肯听他的话，开怀爽快得不得了。要果真这样——人家这样跟我说，而那是劝我要当心——我得告诉你，你太不懂得你自己该怎样，才同做我的女儿和你的清名能相称。你们之间怎么样？对我说真话。	SDY
403	Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?	爱情！呸！你说话真像个傻丫头，全没有经历过这样危险的情势。你相信他的献出吗，如你所说的？	SDY
407	Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!	是啊，你叫它态度；算了吧，算了吧。	SDY
417	No, it is struck.	不，已经敲过。	SDY
424	Look, my lord, it comes!	看啊，殿下，它来了！	SDY
428	Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground. But do not go with it!	看，它姿势有多么温文，招手引您去比较背隐的地方：可不要跟它去。	SDY
435	You shall not go, my lord.	您不能前去，殿下。	SDY
437	Be rul'd. You shall not go.	请听话；不能去。	SDY
446	Enter Ghost and Hamlet.	鬼魂与哈姆雷特上。	SDY
449	I will.	我听。	SDY
452	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.	不用可怜我，只要认真倾听着我要说的事。	SDY
456	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的亡魂；判定了在夜间出现一个时期，白天要禁闭在火里断食悔罪，直到我生前所犯罪恶的孽迹都烧光涤净为止。要不是被禁止，不准泄漏我狱中的那些秘密，我能作一番诉叙，它最轻微的话能叫你的灵魂恼杀，热血冻结，使你的眼睛，流星般跳出眶子来，使你那纠结而梳顺的卷须分开，每一根发丝笔立直竖了起来，好像发怒的豪猪身上的针刺。可是这永劫之秘决不能宣泄给血肉的耳朵听。但听啊，呵，听啊！若是你确曾爱过你亲爱的父亲——	SDY
460	Murther most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.	恶毒的凶杀，说得再好也不外此，但这真穷凶极恶，骇听闻，灭人性。	SDY

465	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!	啊，可怕！啊，可怕！好不可怕哟！	SDY
467	O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart! And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables! Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.] So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word: It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'   I have sworn't.	天兵神将哟！地师土伯们！还有甚？加上幽冥的凶煞吗？挺住，我的心；我的筋腱啊，莫在顷刻间变衰老，绷紧着，把我挺起来。要把你记心上？是啊，只要这神思错乱的头脑里有记忆，可怜的阴魂。要把你记心上？是啊，从我记忆的小手册上面我要抹掉一切琐碎的蠢记录，一切书本上的格言，一切形象，年少时观察所留下的一切戳记；只让你对我提出的这个昭示独独留在我头脑的书卷之中，不羼杂鄙陋的东西；青天在上，啊，最恶劣不堪的妇人！啊，坏蛋，坏蛋，笑吟吟、可恶的坏蛋！我的小手册，——我该把这个记下来，一个人笑吟吟，笑吟吟，可是个坏蛋；至少我知道在丹麦的确是这样：好吧，叔父，给你记上了。现在来听我这话：“再会，再会！要把我记心上。”我立下了誓言。[自内。]殿下！殿下！	SDY

520	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我可以告诉你，至少一般人都是这样传说。刚才它的形象还像我们出现的那位已故的王上，你们知道，曾经接受骄矜好胜的挪威的福丁布拉斯的挑战；在那一次决斗中间，我们的勇武的哈姆雷特——他的英名是举世称颂的——把福丁布拉斯杀死了；按照双方根据法律的武士精神所订立的协定，福丁布拉斯要是战败了，除了他自己的生命以外，必须把他所有的一切土地拨归胜利的一方；同时我们的王上也是提出相当的土地作为赌注，要是福丁布拉斯得胜了，就归他所有，正像在同一协定上所规定的，他失败了，哈姆雷特可以把他的土地没收一样。现在要说起那位福丁布拉斯的儿子，他生得一副烈火也似的性格，已经在挪威的四境召集了一群无赖之徒，供给他们衣食，驱策他们去干冒险的勾当；他的唯一目的，我们的当局看得很清楚，无非是要用武力和强迫性的条件，夺回他父亲所丧失的土地。照我所知道的，这就是我们种种准备的主要动机，我们这样戒备的唯一原因，也是全国所以这样慌忙骚乱的缘故。	ZSH
524	But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion! Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and, race to me, Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),	我要挡住它的去路，即使它会害我。不要走，鬼魂！要是你会开口，对我说话吧；要是我有可以为你效劳之处，使你的灵魂得到安息，那么对我说话吧；要是你预知祖国的命运，靠着你的指示，也许可以及时避免未来灾祸，那么对我说话吧！或者你在生前曾经把你搜刮得来的财宝埋藏在地下，我听见人家说，鬼魂往往在他们藏金的地方徘徊不散，[鸡啼]	ZSH
525	Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!	要是有这样的事，你也对我说吧，不要走，说呀！拦住它，马西勒斯。	ZSH
531	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.	它正要说话的时候，鸡就啼了。	ZSH
532	And then it started, like a guilty thing   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	于是它就像一个罪犯听到了可怕的召唤似的惊跳起来。我听人家说，报晓的雄鸡用它高锐的啼声，唤醒了白昼之神，一听到它的警告，那些在海里、火里、地下、空中到处浪游的有罪的灵魂，就一个个钻回自己的巢穴里去，这句话现在已经证实了。	ZSH
533	It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.	鬼魂在鸡鸣的时候隐去，有人说我们的救主将要诞生之前，这报晓的鸟儿彻夜长鸣；那时候，他们说，没有一个鬼魂可以出外行走，夜间的空气非常清净，没有一颗星用毒光射人，没有一个神仙用法术迷人，妖巫的符咒也失去了力量，一切都是圣洁而美好的。	ZSH
