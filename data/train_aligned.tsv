432	Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?   It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.	为什么，有什么可怕的。我把这生命看得不值一根针；至于我的灵魂，既然也是不灭的，跟它一模一样，它又能奈何它？它还在招呼我去；我要跟它走。	SDY
158	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	你自己就把钥匙收下来保管吧。	BZL
563	Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	不，你是我的好朋友；我愿意和你朋友相称。你怎么不在维滕贝格，霍拉旭？马西勒斯！	ZSH
441	Have after. To what issue wail this come?	跟上去。——这可要弄成什么结局？	SDY

271	Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one-	就在昨天夜里，那时节北极星西首的那颗星儿正好行过去照耀西天的那一方，它如今正在那边亮，马帅勒史和我，刚正敲一点钟——	SDY
182	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的；可是我虽然在这里从小看惯了，却以为这一种风俗，与其遵守它不如破坏它倒来得体面一点。这样的酗酒纵乐使我们受够了东西各国纷纷的议论和低毁；他们叫我们酒鬼，用瘟猪一类话糟蹋了我们的名号：这一种行径也真要抵消了我们的丰功伟业，至少使我们失去了荣誉的精髓了。就个人说来情形也往往如此，有些人品性上有一点小小的暇疵，或者是天生的（那也怪不得他们，因为天性并不能自己作主），或者是由于某一种特殊的气质过分发展到超出了理性的范围，或者是由于养成了一种习惯，过分要一举一动都讨人喜欢，这些人就带了一种缺点的烙印（天然的符号或者是命运的标记），使他们另外的品质（尽管圣桔，尽管多到一个人担当不了，）也就不免在一般的非议中沾染了这个缺点的溃烂症。一点点毛病往往就抵消了一切高贵的品质，害得人声名狼藉。	BZL

557	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	啊，那才是一句有孝心的答复；你将在丹麦享有和我同等的尊荣。御妻，来。哈姆雷特这一种自动的顺从使我非常高兴；为了表示庆祝，今天丹麦王每一次举杯祝饮的时候，都要放一响高入云霄的祝炮，让上天应和着地上的雷鸣，发出欢乐的回声。来。[除哈姆雷特外均下]	ZSH
530	We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	它走了！我们不该用暴力对待这样一个尊严的亡魂；因为它是像空气一样不可侵害的。我们无益的打击不过是恶意的徒劳。	ZSH
396	Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.	再会了，莪斐丽亚；要好好记住我对你说的话。	SDY
622	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	对于哈姆雷特和他的调情献媚，你必须把它认作年轻人一时的感情冲动，一朵初春的紫罗兰，早熟而易凋，馥郁而不能持久，一分钟的芬芳和喜悦，如此而已。	ZSH

Come away.	哎也，这是个亲和、美好的回答：在丹麦跟我们一个样。来吧，贤妻；哈姆雷特这一下允诺，和蔼而语出衷肠，对着我的心在微笑；为表示祝贺，今天丹麦王每一觞欢饮都要有大炮向云天报响，天上将遍传地上君王的畅饮，一声声应和着地上的宏雷。去来。	SDY

433	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other, horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? Think of it. The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.	它引您去到了海里怎么办，殿下，或者去登上可怕的悬崖绝顶，孤悬的岩壁俯瞰着碧深深的海，那里它露出另一副骇人的形相，那也许就会夺去您理智的均衡，使您发疯，那又怎么办？想一下；没有其他的因由，那地方本身就会叫人起浑不顾一切的怪想，只要他俯对那么多噚下的海水，听它在下面呼啸。	SDY
538	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然我们亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特新丧未久，我们的心里应当充满了悲痛，我们全国都应当表示一致的哀悼，可是我们凛于后死者责任的重大，不能不违情逆性，一方面固然要用适度的悲哀纪念他，一方面也要为自身的利害着想；所以，在一种悲喜交集的情绪之下，让幸福和忧郁分据了我的两眼，殡葬的挽歌和结婚的笙乐同时并奏，用盛大的喜乐抵消沉重的不幸，我已经和我旧日的长嫂，当今的王后，这一个多事之国的共同的统治者，结为夫妇；这一次婚姻事先曾经征求各位的意见，多承你们诚意的赞助，这是我必须向大家致谢的。现在我要让你们知道，年轻的福丁布拉斯看轻了我们的实力，也许他以为自从我们亲爱的王兄驾崩以后，我们的国家已经瓦解，所以挟着他的从中取利的梦想，不断向我们书画要求把他的父亲依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的土地归还。这是他一方面的话。现在要讲到我们的态度和今天召集各位来此的目的。我们的对策是这样的：我这儿已经写好了一封信给挪威国王，年轻的福丁布拉斯的叔父，他因为卧病在床，不曾与闻他侄子的企图，在信里我请他注意他的侄子擅自在国内征募壮丁，训练士卒，积极进行各种准备的事实，要求他从速制止他的进一步的行动；现在我就派遣你，考尼律斯，还有你，伏提曼德，替我把这封信送给挪威老王，除了训令上所规定的条件以外，你们不得僭用你们的权力，和挪威成立逾越范围的妥协。你们赶紧就去吧，再会！	ZSH

Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables! Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.] So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word: It is 'Adieu, adieu!

Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes.

516	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正像你就是你自己一样。它身上的那副战铠，正是他讨伐野心的挪威王的时候所穿的；它脸上的那副怒容，活像他有一次和敌人谈判决裂以后，把那些乘雪车的波兰人打倒在冰上的时候的神气，怪事怪事！	ZSH
375	His beard was grizzled- no?	他须髯是灰的不？	SDY
304	And then it started, like a guilty thing   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	它就像是个有罪的犯人一般，听到可怕的召唤而一惊。我听说公鸡，它是替早晨报晓的号角手，一阵阵啼响它高亢峻峭的喉咙，把白日的神灵唤醒；一经它警告不论在海里火里，在地下或空中，每一个游灵野魅便自会慌忙赶回它的本界；刚才所见的东西便可以证明这句话说得不假。	SDY
97	A truant disposition, good my lord.	无非是因为偷懒，爱逃学，殿下。	BZL
62	Tis here!	在这儿！	BZL
272	Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!	噤声！莫讲了；您瞧，它又在来了！	SDY

283	Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!	站住了！说话，说话！命令你，说话！	SDY
519	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来。谁要是知道的，请告诉我，为什么我们要有这样森严的戒备，使全国的军民每夜不得安息；为什么每天都在制造铜炮，还要向国外购买战具；为什么赶造这许多船只，连星期日也不停止工作；这样夜以继日地辛苦忙碌，究竟为了什么？谁能告诉我？	ZSH
178	No, it is struck.	不，已经敲过了。	BZL
625	I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.	我将要记住你这个很好的教训，让它看守着我的心。可是，我的好哥哥，你不要像有些坏牧师一样，指点我上天去的险峻的荆棘之途，自己却在花街柳巷流连忘返，忘记了自己的箴言。	ZSH
420	The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.	君王今晚上准备着彻夜行觞，要纵酒逞欢，再加上喧闹的狂舞；他每干一樽莱茵美酒的当儿，铜鼓和军号便这么嗥啸出一阵他祝酒的豪兴。	SDY
58	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),   The cock crows. Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!	莫非你生前在地下哪一个角落里埋下了你一生搜刮得来的财宝，因此，据说，人死后还要出鬼的，〔鸡啼。说出来！别走，说！拦住它，玛塞勒斯！	BZL
634	Farewell.Exit.	再会！[下]	ZSH
209	My hour is almost come, When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.	我的时间快到了，我必须马上再回到琉璜的烈火里去受尽熬炼。	BZL
591	Both [and Ber.] We do, my lord.	是，殿下。	ZSH
288	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正好跟你像你自己一个样：他当年正是披戴着这一身盔甲，对野心的挪威国王单身去决斗；有一次也曾这样怒冲冲，谈判时给激怒，他斫冰上乘橇的波兰王。真是奇怪。	SDY
47	Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. 	老天爷在上，要不是我身历其境，亲眼看见，证明是千真万确，我怎么也不会相信。	BZL

332	I am glad to see you well. Horatio!- or I do forget myself.	见到你我很高兴。霍瑞旭，——要是不然，我忘记了自己。	SDY
290	In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	我可不知道该作怎样的想法；不过就我所看到的大体来说，这预兆对于邦国有惊人的动荡。	SDY
284	Tis gone and will not answer.	它走了，不肯答话。	SDY
25	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?	怎样，那东西今晚上可又出现了？	BZL
545	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-	好好利用你的时间，雷欧提斯，尽情发挥你的才能吧！可是，来，我的侄儿哈姆雷特，我的孩子——	ZSH
680	Heaven will direct it.	上帝的旨意支配一切。	ZSH
197	My fate cries out And makes each petty artire in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.[Ghost beckons.]   Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!- I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.	我的命运在呼唤，它使我身上的每一条微细的血管都变得象尼缅狮子的筋络样繃硬。它还在叫我。你们快放手，朋友；（挣脱。（鬼魂招手我发誓，谁还要挡住我，我叫他变鬼！小心，走开！——走吧；我一路跟来。（鬼魂与哈姆雷特下。	BZL

35	In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  	一模一样，正象我们的先王。	BZL
409	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	是啊，捕捉傻山鹬的罗网。我知道，当欲火熏蒸的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头滥发盟誓；这些发光焰，女儿，光多于热，一烧亮就熄灭，正在答应时，跟正在烧亮时一样，你切勿把它们当火。从今往后要少露你那闺女的声色于他；将你的会晤要看得比一声传令去面谈更值价。对哈姆雷特殿下，要信任他到这一步，就是他年纪还轻，他可以行动自由的限度比你大得多：干脆说，莪斐丽亚，别信他的盟誓；它们穿针引线，不是它们的衣裳所显示的颜色，而只是追求调情打趣的坏家伙，气息倒像是假装圣洁的臭虔婆，为的是更好欺骗人。归总一句话：讲得简单明了些，从现在开始，我不准你随便糟蹋片刻的闲暇，再去跟哈姆雷特殿下说甚话。要好生注意，关照你：来吧。	SDY
154	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	父亲在上，孩儿就此告辞了。	BZL
405	Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly, Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.	我来教你吧：把你自己当娃娃，你竟把这些献出当真正的付款，它们可不是纹银。显出你自己多值些钱吧；否则——且不叫这句话跑伤气，这么说——你显出自己是傻瓜。	SDY
84	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样当孝子，居丧尽哀，足见你天性纯笃，大可称道，但是须知你父亲失去过父亲，那个父亲也曾失去过父亲，后死者要克尽孝道，自然要哀悼一个时期。但是漫无止境，哀毁逾恒，却正是不够孝顺的一种行径，不够堂堂男子气；这反而表现出意志是逆天背理，心是经不起磨练，性情是暴躁，头脑是十分简单，毫无修养。既然我们知道是无可避免的，而且同家常便饭一样的普通，为什么我们要赌气，老记在心上呢？咦！这种行径是违反了上天，违反了死者，违反了人情世故，最蛮不讲理，全不管丁忧丧父在理性是看作常事的，全不管理性就从第一遭变故直喊到如今：“这是不可避免的！”我请你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；我要全世界知道你是我的王位的最直接继承人；最好的慈父怎样用最大的慈爱对待儿子，我就怎样对待你，决不比他差一分。至于你想要回到威登堡大学去继续读书，这种想法是最不合我的意思的；我请你、一定要勉强你、留在这里，使满朝欣慰，当我的第一名重臣，不愧为王上的爱侄，王上的宠儿。	BZL
583	Two nights together had these gentlemen (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch In the dead vast and middle of the night Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位朋友，马西勒斯和勃那多，在万籁俱寂的午夜守望的时候，曾经连续两夜看见一个自顶至踵全身甲胄，像您父亲一样的人形，在他们的面前出现，用庄严而缓慢的步伐走过他们的身边。在他们惊奇骇愕的眼前，它三次走过去，它手里所握的鞭杖可以碰到他们的身上；他们吓得几乎浑身都瘫痪了，只是呆立着不动，一句话也没有对它说。怀着惴惧的心情，他们把这件事悄悄地告诉了我，我就在第三夜陪着他们一起守望；正像他们所说的一样，那鬼魂又出现了，出现的时间和他的形状，证实了他们的每一个字都是正确的。我认识您的父亲，那鬼魂是那样酷肖他的生前，我这两手也不及他们彼此的相似。	ZSH
555	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	不要让你母亲的祈求全归无用，哈姆雷特；请你不要离开我们，不要到维滕贝格去。	ZSH
644	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	而且，父亲，他差不多用尽一切指天誓日的神圣的盟约，证实他的言语。	ZSH
87	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	这样回答才真是有头脑，能体贴！你留在丹麦就和我不分彼此吧。夫人，来吧。我听了哈姆雷特这样子惠然允诺，高兴得心都笑了：为了表示庆祝，今天丹麦王每于一次杯都要放一次大炮，高响入云，叫夭上把欢乐传开去，一声声回应着地上的雷鸣。来吧。	BZL
665	It will not speak. Then will I follow it.	它不肯说话；我还是跟它去。	ZSH
120	Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? Both [and Ber.] We do, my lord.	不错，不错。这可搅得我心乱了。你们今晚上还守夜吗？玛、贝守，殿下。	BZL
588	Tis very strange.	这很奇怪。	ZSH
44	Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! Exit Ghost.	别走！说呀，说呀！我命令你说话！（鬼魂下	BZL
101	Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.	的确，婚礼也就紧接着来了。	BZL
462	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看你容易激发；你要是对这件事情不采取行动，那就比遗忘川夹岸臭烂的莠草更要迟钝了。听我说，哈姆雷特：据他们宣称，我在御花园里睡觉，有条蛇螫了我；全丹麦人的耳朵就误被这个捏造的我的死因卑劣地蒙骗住：可是你，年轻有为，要知道那条螫死你父亲的毒虺现在正戴着王冠。	SDY
636	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 	回父亲的话，我们刚才谈起哈姆雷特殿下的事情。	ZSH
364	What, look'd he frowningly.	怎么！他可是蹙着眉头吗？	SDY
560	Hail to your lordship!	祝福，殿下！	ZSH
486	Give you good night.	祝你们晚安！	ZSH
107	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	殿下，我昨夜好象又看见了他。	BZL
150	For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	一个人成长，并非是只长筋肉，只长躯体；这一副架子扩大了，内心活动要求的香花供奉也就增加了，也许他现在是爱你的，现在还没有龌龊的心机糟蹋他纯洁的愿望：可是你必须留心：地位太高，一想到就不能由自己作得了主意；他得受身分的拘束。他倒不可能，就象普通人一样的，自己挑选，因为他选对了没有都会影响到国家的安危隆替；他是国家的首脑，他的选择就必须先得到国家的同意和批准。所以，如果你听到他对你说他爱你，你不该轻易听信，你得认清楚：照他的身分行事，他究竟有几分说得到做得到；他怎样也不能跳出决定一切的丹麦王许可的限度。如果你耳根太软，听他的花腔迷了心，对他冒失的苦苦哀求打开了贞洁的宝藏，你可以想一想你的名誉会受到多大的损失。当心啊，莪菲丽亚，当心啊，亲爱的妹妹，你要尽可能留在你感情的后方，避开欲望能袭击的危险范围。一位小心的姑娘，如果对月亮敞开了自己的美丽，就算够放浪了；守身加工还难免受诽谤打击；春天的嫩苗还没有开花放苞，毛虫就往往钻进去把它咬伤；青春年少、朝露晶洼的时候，发瘟的风霜随时会摧残到头上。所以要小心啊；随时警惕最安全：不煽动，青春也就会对自己造反。	BZL
662	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	它招手叫您跟着它去，好像它有什么话要对您一个人说似的。	ZSH

What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	现在，雷欧提斯，你有什么话说？你对我说你有一个请求；是什么请求，雷欧提斯？只要是合理的事情，你向丹麦王说了，他总不会不答应你。你有什么要求，雷欧提斯，不是你未开口我就自动许给了你？丹麦王室和你父亲的关系，正像头脑之于心灵一样密切；丹麦国王乐意为你父亲效劳，正像嘴里所说的话，可以由双手去执行一样。你要些什么，雷欧提斯？	ZSH
691	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	你听了以后，必须替我报仇。	ZSH

'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看出你是积极的；你如果对这件事情不采取行动，就比忘川河岸上懒坏的水草还要迟钝了。得，哈姆雷特，听我说。人家宣布说，我在花园里睡觉，一条蛇把我咬了。这一个虚构的死因，恶毒万分，把丹麦全国的听闻一手遮掩了。可是你，高贵的青年，要知道那一条咬死你父亲的毒蛇现在就戴了王冠。怪不得我先恨啊！	BZL

The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我们也深信无疑：祝两位顺遂。现在，赉候底施，你可有什么事？你曾说有请求；要怎样，赉候底施？你不会对丹麦当今请求得有理，而将话白说；什么事，赉候底施，你有所要求，我不会给你满足？头脑不会跟心儿更加相一致，这只手不会跟这张嘴起到作用，比较丹麦的当今对于你父亲。你有何要求，赉候底施？	SDY

That it should come to this! But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太太结实的肉体（众下，仅留哈姆雷特。融了，解了，化成了一片露水；但愿天经地义并没有一条严禁自杀的戒律！上帝啊！上帝啊！我觉得人世间醉生梦死的一套是多么无聊，乏味，无一是处！呔！呔！这是个荒废的花园，一天天零落；生性芜秽的蔓草全把它占据了。居然有这等事情！才死了两个月！不，还不到两个月。这样好一位国王，比起这一位简直是海庇亮比萨徒；对我的母亲又这样恩爱，简直不容许天风吹痛了她的脸庞。上天下地！定要我记住吗？当日啊，她依他傍他，仿佛是越尝滋味越开了胃口；然而，还不出一个月——我简直不敢想！脆弱啊，你的名字就叫女人！——短短一个月，她象泪人儿一样纷我父亲送葬去穿的鞋子还一点都没有穿旧呢，哎呀，你看她，（无知的畜生也还会哀痛得久一点呢！）她居然就同我的叔父结婚了；我这个叔父可绝不象他的哥哥，正如我不象赫勾列啊！还不出一个月，不等她假仁假义的眼泪干了，不等她热辣的眼睛消去了红肿，她就结婚了。赶急得真是作孽啊，这样轻捷的钻进了乱他的衾被！	BZL

'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样孝思不匮，原是你天性中纯笃过人之处；可是你要知道，你的父亲也曾失去过一个父亲，那失去的父亲自己也失去过父亲；那后死的儿子为了尽他的孝道，必须有一个时期服丧守制，然而固执不变的哀伤，却是一种逆天悖理的愚行，不是堂堂男子所应有的举动；它表现出一个不肯安于天命的意志，一个经不起艰难痛苦的心，一个缺少忍耐的头脑和一个简单愚昧的理性。既然我们知道那是无可避免的事，无论谁都要遭遇到同样的经验，那么我们为什么要这样固执地把它介意于怀呢？嘿！那是对上天的罪戾，对死者的罪戾，也是违反人情的罪戾；在理智上它是完全荒谬的，因为从第一个死了的父亲起，直到今天死去的最后一个父亲为止，理智永远在呼喊：“这是无可避免的。”我请你抛弃了这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；因为我要让全世界知道，你是王位直接的继承者，我要给你尊荣和恩宠，不亚于一个最慈爱的父亲之于他的儿子。至于你要回到维滕贝格去继续求学的意思，那是完全违反我们的愿望的；请你听从我的劝告，不要离开这里，在朝廷上领袖群臣，做我们最亲近的国亲和王子，使我们因为每天能够看见你而感到欢欣。	ZSH

553	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好像，母亲！不，是这样就是这样，我不知道什么“好像”不“好像”。好妈妈，我的墨黑的外套，礼俗上规定的丧服，勉强吐出来的叹气，像滚滚江流一样的眼泪，悲苦沮丧的脸色，以及一切仪式、外表和忧伤的流露，都不能表示出我的真实的情绪。这些才真是给人瞧的，因为谁都可以做作成这种样子。它们不过是悲哀的装饰和衣服；可是我郁结的心事却无法表现出来的。	ZSH

699	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我的话果然激动了你；要是你听见了这种事情而漠然无动于衷，那你除非比疏散在忘河之滨的蔓草还要冥顽不灵。现在，哈姆雷特，听我说；一般人都以为我在花园里睡觉的时候，一条蛇来把我螫死，这一个虚构的死状，把丹麦全国的人都骗过了；可是你要知道，好孩子，那毒害你父亲的蛇，头上戴着王冠呢。	ZSH

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, 	我可以；至少传说是如此，先王陛下，刚才还仿佛露过了一下子脸呢，当年碰上了挪威王福丁布拉斯骄矜好胜，一定要前来挑战，你们都知道的；我们英武的哈姆雷特是举世闻名的，就在一场决斗中杀死了福丁布拉斯，事先有协定，双方批准，还郑重宣布过公约，败者结果是不但断送了性命而且把所有的土地送给了胜者。先玉当然也提出过相当的土地押了注：要是福丁布拉斯得胜呢，这部分土地也就归他所有，正如协定中同一款明文规定的、他要是失败，就得把所有的土地转送给哈姆雷特。如今小福丁布拉斯狙气方刚，还不知天高地厚，已经在挪威边境，东一处西一处，招聚了一批没有土地的亡命徒，管他们吃喝，要他们大举出动尝一尝冒险的滋味；用意所在，我们的当局看得清清楚楚，无非是要用武力和强迫手段。	BZL

223	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是那一个通奸乱伦的禽兽，就凭他诡计多端，花样百出，（邪恶的才智啊，这样子有本事诱骗人！）为了满足他极端无耻的兽欲，骗上了我那位最显得贞洁的王后。啊，哈姆雷特，这是怎样的堕落啊，不管我的爱情是这样庄严。完全匹配了我跟她结婚的盟誓，竟至于屈尊就教这一个坏蛋，不看他天赋的才德比我的要低不知多少倍！贞操，尽管让淫欲扮做了天仙前来求爱，也永远不为所动，色情，尽管跟光华的天使结了婚，也会厌弃了至尊极乐的天床吃人家垃圾。慢一点！我好象闻到了早晨的气息；我说得简单些。我在花园里睡觉，我每天午后照例要这样歇一下，想不到你的叔父竟乘我不备，溜进来，用了一小瓶该死的乌木汁，把我的两只耳朵一齐都灌了。这一种麻疯式毒精跟人的血液死不两立，会马上就发作起来，滴溜溜象水银一样，无孔不入，一下子通遍了全身的大门小径，力道猛极了，象酸液滴进了牛奶，一下子把全身鲜活流畅的血液都凝结起来。我的血液就这样了；而且立刻有无数的疹泡，麻疯样，带着可怕的疤片，盖住了我全身光滑的皮肤。我就这样在睡梦中由一个弟兄一下子夺去了生命，王冠，王后！就在罪孽深重里一命归天，来不及举行圣餐礼，忏悔，涂膏，来不及结一结清楚，就叫我算了帐，不管我满头是未清未净的红尘。	BZL

A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位士子，马帅勒史和剖那陀，一连两个夜晚在他们警卫时，在宵深夜里、死一般冥寂之中，他们碰上了。先王般的一个形象，从头到脚，全副的披挂簇崭齐，在他们面前现形，用庄严的步伐缓慢而威灵地走过他们：他三回走过他们惊骇得欲绝的眼前，跟他们相差不到他一权杖之隔；他们害怕得几乎化成了肉冻，站着像哑巴，不敢对他去开腔。他们把这事惴悚悚秘密告诉我；第三夜我和他们一同去守卫；在那里，正如他们所说的，时间也对，模样也对，每句话都证实，那鬼魂又来了。我认识殿下的父王；这两只手不能更像。	SDY

Yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanish'd from our sight.	殿下，我说了，可是它没有回答我；不过有一次我觉得它好像抬起头来，像要开口说话似的，可是就在那个时候，晨鸡高声啼了起来，它一听见鸡声，就很快地隐去不见了。	ZSH

423	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	是的，凭圣处女：不过在我看来，我虽然在本地生长，日常已见惯，这可是个习俗，遵守它倒不如破坏它更加光荣。这样的酗酒耽乐使我们备受东西诸邦一体的讥讪和责骂；他们叫我们醉鬼，用泥猪那类话玷污我们的称号；那么着也就当真消减了我们丰伟的勋业，把我们声望里的精华、真髓抽去。所以，往往在有些个人身上，因他们本来有某种天生的缺陷，与生俱来，——那可怪不得他们，既然生命不可能自己去选来历——由于某一种性癖有过度的滋长，时常冲破了理性的藩篱与堡砦，或者有什么习惯过于发扬了令人爱的心性形态；却说这些人——他们沾上了那种缺陷的印记，那缺陷，不出于天然，即肇自命运——他们其他的美德，即令清纯得了不起，即令没涘涯，非凡人所能有，将在世人的见解中，因那个缺失而遭到毁伤败坏；一些些乖舛会招致对整个高贵品质的狐疑，使声名狼藉。	SDY

All that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.  	好哈姆雷特，脱下你的黑衣，对你的父王应该和颜悦色一点；不要老是垂下了眼皮，在泥土之中找寻你的高贵的父亲。你知道这是一件很普通的事情，活着的人谁都要死去，从生存的空间踏进了永久的宁静。	ZSH

66	It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.	刚才它真是一听到鸡叫就隐去了。有人说，每逢我们要庆祝圣诞，在节日前几天，这种报晓的家禽就开始彻夜不停的啼了又啼；那时候，他们说，精灵部不敢出来。夜夜安全，星宿不作怪、害人，妖女不迷人，妖巫也使不了符咒，那真是圣洁、祥和的好时候，好节气。	BZL

Tender yourself more dearly, Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.	我教你想吧：你是个三岁小孩，随他“捧”出来什么，都当是真东西！你该把自己的身价“捧”得高一点，（可怜这小字眼跑野马要跑断气了）当心你给我“捧”出来一个小傻瓜！	BZL

522	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.	那是扰乱我们心灵之眼的一点微尘。从前在富强繁盛的罗马，当那雄才大略的尤利乌斯·恺撒驾崩以前不久的时候，披着殓衾的死人都从坟墓里走出来，在街道上啾啾鬼语，拖着火尾、喷着血露的星辰在白昼陨落，支配潮汐的月亮被吞蚀得像一个没有起色的病人；这一类预报重大变故的征兆，在我们国内也已经屡次出现了，可是不要响！瞧！瞧！它又来了！	ZSH

85	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	别让你母亲自费唇舌吧，哈姆雷特：我请你别离开我们，别再去威登堡了。	BZL
291	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来，谁知道就请告诉我，为什么要这样严谨、周密的警卫，使海内的臣民每天都彻夜辛勤；为什么要这样日日去铸造铜炮，且又向外邦去购买刀枪和火药；为什么要这样征用造船的工匠，他们得终周劳苦，礼拜天也不歇；有什么事情会发生，叫人要这么汗流浃背，日夜忙急得没安息：谁能告诉我这件事？	SDY

71	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	至亲的先兄哈姆雷特驾崩未久，记忆犹新，大家固然是应当哀戚于心，应该让全国上下愁眉不展，共结成一片哀容，然而理智和感情交战的结果，我们就一边用适当的哀思悼念他。一边也不忘记我们自己的本分。因此，仿佛抱昔中作乐的心情，仿佛一只眼含笑，一只眼流泪，仿佛使殡丧同喜庆歌哭相和，使悲喜成半斤八两，彼此相应，我已同昔日的长嫂，当今的新后，承袭我邦家大业的先王德配，结为夫妇：事先也多方听取了各位的高见，多承一致拥护，一切顺利；为此，特申谢意。如今，各位知道的，小福丁布拉斯，少年气盛，小看了我们的力量，或者妄以为先兄一朝弃世，我们的国家忽然脱了节，脱了榫，单凭了自以为有机可乘的梦想。他就一再送文书前来烦读，要求我们归还他父亲的失地，全不管那些土地是依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的。别再讲他了。现在转回来讲我们这次的会议。事情是这样：我有国书一封写好在此，预备送挪威国王，小福了布拉斯的叔父，他老病经年，卧床不起，并不知悉他侄儿在国内招兵买马，用意何在，因此就请他从速制止他侄儿进一步有所行动。我特此遣派你，考奈留斯，还有你，伏尔第曼德，当这次通问挪威玉国的信使，但是你们和国王进行交涉、不得越权，不得擅自超出了这些训令所明白规定的范围。再见吧！愿速去速回，以表忠诚。考、伏赴汤蹈火，一切定当效命。	BZL

170	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	捕捉傻鹁鸪的天罗地网！我知道，欲火上升的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头乱发誓言的。这种火，小丫头，要知道，是光多于热，都不过一现，刚刚发出来，一下子就热退光消了，你千万别当作是真火。从今以后多注意你千金身分，少出头露面吧。你要高高在上，别一听呼召便移樽就教。对于哈姆雷特殿下，你应该明白这一点：他还年轻，而且他可以自由活动的场面比你的广得多。总而言之，莪菲丽亚，别相信他的盟誓；那是牵线人，身上穿的衣裳是洁白，干净，心里转的念头是卑鄙，龊龊，就象龟婆冒充圣徒，假正经，为了更便于骗人。干脆一句话，从今以后，哪怕是片刻的闲工夫我都不准你这样子随便糟蹋、再后来跟哈姆雷特殿下说话！好好留神，我要你记住。来吧。	BZL

549	Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.	不，陛下，我已经在太阳里晒得太久了。	ZSH
642	My lord, he hath importun'd me with love In honourable fashion.	父亲，他向我求爱的态度是很光明正大的。	ZSH
624	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	不过如此；因为像新月一样逐渐饱满的人生，不仅是肌肉和体格的成长，而且随着身体的发展，精神和心灵也同时扩大。也许他现在爱你，他的真诚的意志是纯洁而不带欺诈的；可是你必须留心，他有这样高的地位，他的意志并不属于他自己，因为他自己也要被他的血统所支配；他不能像一般庶民一样为自己选择，因为他的决定足以影响到整个国家的安危，他是全身的首脑，他的选择必须得到各部分肢体的同意；所以要是他说，他爱你，你不可贸然相信，应该明白：照他的身份地位来说，他要想把自己的话付诸实现，绝不能越出丹麦国内普遍舆论所同意的范围。你再想一想，要是你用过于轻信的耳朵倾听他的歌曲，让他攫走了你的心，在他的狂妄的渎求之下，打开了你的宝贵的童贞，那时候你的名誉将要蒙受多大的损失。留心，奥菲利娅，留心，我的亲爱的妹妹，不要放纵你的爱情，不要让欲望的利箭把你射中。一个自爱的女郎不应该向月亮显露她的美貌；圣贤也不能逃避谗口的中伤；春天的草木往往还没有吐放它们的蓓蕾，就被蛀虫蠹蚀；朝露一样晶莹的青春，常常会受到罡风的吹打。所以留心吧，戒惧是最安全的方策；即使没有旁人的诱惑，少年的血气也要向他自己叛变。	ZSH

147	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	哈姆雷特对你要好，乱献殷勤，要认清那只是赶时髦，做感情游戏；只是青春里出现的一朵紫罗兰，开得早，谢得快，甜甜的，可不能持久；只供一刹那赏乐的一阵花香：如此而已。	BZL

658	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的。可是我虽然从小就熟习这种风俗，我却以为把它破坏了倒比遵守它还体面些，这一种酗酒纵乐的风俗，使我们在东西各国受到许多非议；他们称我们为酒徒醉汉，将下流的污名加在我们头上，使我们各项伟大的成就都因此而大为减色。在个人方面也常常是这样，有些人因为身体上长了丑恶的黑痣——这本来是天生的缺陷，不是他们自己的过失——或者生就一种令人侧目的怪癖，虽然他们此外还有许多纯洁优美的品性，可是为了这一个缺点，往往会受到世人的歧视。一点丑恶就毁坏了高贵的品质，使人声名狼藉。	ZSH

Break we our watch up; and by my advice   Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? 	我也听人家这样说过，倒有几分相信。可是瞧，清晨披着赤褐色的外衣，已经踏着那边东方高山上的露水走过来了。我们也可以下班了。照我的意思，我们应该把我们今夜看见的事情告诉年轻的哈姆雷特；因为凭着我的生命起誓，这一个鬼魂虽然对我们不发一言，但见了哈姆雷特一定有话要说。你们以为按照我们的忠心和责任说起来，是不是应当让他知道这件事情？	ZSH

701	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	嗯，那个乱伦的奸淫的畜生，他有的是过人的诡诈，天赋的奸恶，凭着他的阴险的手段，诱惑了我的外表上似乎非常贞淑的王后，满足他的无耻的兽欲。啊，哈姆雷特，那是一个多么相去悬殊的差异！我的爱情是那样纯洁真诚，始终信守着我在结婚的时候对她所作的盟誓；她却会对一个天赋的才德远不如我的恶人降心相从！可是正像一个贞洁的女子，虽然淫欲罩上神圣的外表，也不能把她煽动一样，一个淫妇虽然和光明的天使为偶，也会有一天厌倦于天上的唱随之乐，而宁愿搂抱人间的朽骨。可是且慢！我仿佛嗅到了清晨的空气，让我把话说得简短一些，当我按照每天午后的惯例，在花园里睡觉的时候，你的叔父趁我不备，悄悄溜了进来，拿着一个盛着毒草汁的小瓶，把一种使人麻痹的药水注入我的耳腔之内，那药性发作起来，会像水银一样很快地流过全身的大小血管，像酸液滴进牛乳般地把淡薄而健全的血液凝结起来；它一进入我的身体里，我全身光滑的皮肤上便立刻长出无数疱疹，像害着癞病似的满布着可憎的鳞片。这样，我在睡梦之中，被一个兄弟同时夺去了我的生命、我的王冠和我的王后；甚至不给我一个忏罪的机会，使我在没有领到圣餐也没有受过临终涂膏礼时，就一无准备地负着我的全部罪恶去对簿阴曹。可怕啊，可怕！要是你有天性之情，不要默尔而息，不要让丹麦的御寝变成了藏奸养逆的卧榻；可是无论你怎样进行复仇，你的行事必须光明磊落，更不可对你的母亲有什么不利的图谋，她自会受到上天的裁判，和她自己内心中的荆棘的刺戳。现在我必须去了！萤火的微光已经开始暗淡下去，清晨快要到来了；再会，再会！哈姆雷特，记着我。[下]	ZSH

702	O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart! And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables! Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.] So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word: It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'   I have sworn't.	天上的神明啊！地啊！再有什么呢！我还要向地狱呼喊吗？啊，呸！忍着吧，忍着吧，我的心！我的全身的筋骨，不要一下子就变成衰老，支持着我的身体呀！记着你！是的，我可怜的亡魂，当记忆不曾从我这混乱的头脑里消失的时候，我会记着你的。记着你！是的，我要从我的记忆的碑版上，拭去一切琐碎愚蠢的记录、一切书本上的格言、一切陈言套语、一切过去的印象，我的少年的阅历所留下的痕迹，只让你的命令留在我的脑筋的书卷里，不掺杂一些下贱的废料；是的，上天为我做证！啊，最恶毒的妇人！啊，奸贼，奸贼，脸上堆着笑的万恶的奸贼！我的写字板呢？我必须把它记下来：一个人尽管满面都是笑，骨子里却是杀人的奸贼；至少我相信在丹麦是这样的。[写字]好，叔父，我把你写下来了。现在我要记下我的话，那是：“再会，再会！记着我。”我已经发过誓了。	ZSH

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.	这真是搅扰人心眼的一粒尘埃。从前在共和罗马鼎盛的首都，在显赫的恺撒大将遇害前不久，坟墓尽走空，死尸裹着入殓衣，到罗马街头去唧唧啾啾地乱叫；星子拖着火焰尾，露珠里含血水，太阳变惨白；还有那水上的冰轮，奈泼钧的万顷海疆要听它挥运，晦蚀得黯淡无光，像世界末日届；而大劫临头、灾殃下降的朕兆，——如前驱使者们总是先命运而来，祸事将至时必有开场的楔子，——天公和地母都已经上下一起来，把它们向宗邦和万民作过昭示。莫作声，看啊！看那边，它又来了！我中魔也要面对它。站住，幻象！你要是能发出声音，会通达言语，[鬼张臂。]就对我说话：要是有什么好事可以去办了，好叫你安舒，且对我能有荣誉，就对我说话：要是你秘密知晓宗邦的命运，也许我们预先知道了能防避，啊！你就讲；或者你要是在生前用强取得了财宝埋藏在地下哪一处洞窟里，为那个，人家说，你们鬼魂常出现，讲出来：站住了，说话！马帅勒史，拦住它。	SDY

464	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是的，那个通奸乱伦的禽兽就仗那诡诈的迷功，叛逆的本领——啊，邪恶的聪明和才智，这么样会奸骗！——把我这貌似贞洁的王后，诱得满足了他那无耻的淫欲：啊，哈姆雷特，多自甘的下贱哟！我对她的爱是那么精醇可贵，那和我跟她义结百年姻好时所起的信誓完全相符契，而她竟会委身于这样个伧夫，他对我有什么才智来相比！但正如美德，它永远也不会动心，即令浪荡装扮成天仙来求爱，淫欲，尽管跟光艳的天使结了婚，还会在极乐的天床上感到餍足，而要去贪吃臭烂。且住！我好似闻到了早晨的清气；让我简单说。我在御园里偃息，那是我每天经常的习惯要歇晌，你那叔父偷偷地趁着我不备窜进来，手持一瓶恶毒的紫杉汁，把那引发起全身恶癞的毒精灌进了我的耳孔去；那药性一发就跟人周身的血液水火不相容，只顷刻之间，快得和水银相似，它通行无阻，穿门过路处处到，而且它发作快而猛，像醋酸滴进牛奶，把我的稀薄而健全的血液凝敛冻结了起来：我的血便这样；而且顿时立刻有疹疱散布开，像是大麻风，可恨的呕人的恶癞结满我光滑的全身。便这样，我在睡梦中被一个兄弟一下子把生命、王冠、王后都夺去：就在罪孽深重里一命抛黄泉，来不及接受圣餐，作忏悔，涂油膏，不曾能结算，还戴着满头罪孽，就给赶送到上帝跟前去清账。	SDY

So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太凝固的肉体会融化，消解，稀释成一滴露水；但愿永恒的主宰没有制定过禁止人自戮的戒律！上帝啊！上帝！这人间一切的常行惯例对于我显得多可厌，陈腐，乏味和无聊！呸呸！啊，这是个芜秽的荒园，丛生着野草；到处是藜蒿与荆蓁，塞地幔天。竟到这样的地步！才死了两个月！不，还不到两月：恁英明一位君主；比起这个来，犹如太阳神比妖仙；他对我母亲这么样亲爱，简直不容许天风吹打上她的脸庞。天公与地母！定要我回想吗？哎也，她偎依着他，仿佛食进得越多，越发加大了胃口；可是，仅仅在一个月之内，莫让我想起——“脆弱”，你名字叫女人！短短一个月，她和那荷琵一个样，涕泪交横，跟着我父亲去送葬穿的鞋还没有穿旧，她呀，就是她——上帝啊！一头全没有理性的畜生也会哀悼得长久些——跟叔父成了婚，我父亲的兄弟，但毫不跟他相像，正如我不像赫勾理斯：一个月之内，不等她佯悲假痛的眼泪停止流，不等她哭痛的眼睛消退红肿，她就结了婚。啊，慌忙得好棘手，迅捷地匆匆引荐于淫乱的床褥！这不是好事，也决不会有好结果：可是，宁肯心碎吧，我必须住口。	SDY

The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我深信二位的热忱。愿二位珍重！现在，莱阿替斯，你有什么事情呢？你说过有所请求。就说吧，莱阿替斯。丹麦王只要听你说得有理，〔考奈留斯与伏尔弟曼德下。总会答应的。你对我有什么要求还怕不会是未开口先到手，莱阿替斯？丹麦王座对于你的父亲就象头对于心一样的休戚相关，就象手对于嘴一样的乐于效劳。你想要怎样，莱阿替斯？	BZL

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen. Enter Ghost again. But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and, race to me, Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!	这是搅得乱心眼的一点灰尘。从前，就在全盛时代的罗马，在雄才盖世的恺撒遇害前不久，坟墓都开了，陈死人裹着入殓衣，都出来到罗马街头啾啾的乱叫；天上星拖着火尾巴，露水带血，太阳发黑：向来是控制大海、支配潮汐的月亮，病容满面，昏沉得好象已经到世界末日。劫数临头、大难将至以前，总会先出现种种不祥的征象，如今天上和地上一齐出动，一再把这一类重大变故的预兆对我们国家和人民显示出来了。鬼魂重上。噢，别作声！看！看它又来了！我着邪也要拦住它！别走，影子！只要是你也会开口，也会用舌头的，对我说话吧！莫非你有什么好事要人家来做，好使你安心，也使我行了功德，对我说说！莫非你预先知道祖国的命运，讲出来也许使我们能避免灾殃，说呀！	BZL

693	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，因为生前孽障未尽，被判在晚间游行地上，白昼忍受火焰的烧灼，必须经过相当的时期，等生前的过失被火焰净化以后，方才可以脱罪。可是我不能违犯禁令，泄露我的狱中的秘密，我可以告诉你一个故事，最轻微的几句话都可以使你魂飞魄散，使你年轻的血液凝冻成冰，使你的双眼像脱了轨道的星球一样向前突出，使你的纠结的鬈发根根分开，像愤怒的豪猪身上的刺毛一样森然耸立；可是这一种永恒的神秘，是不能向血肉的凡耳宣示的，听着，听着，啊，听着！要是你曾经爱过你的亲爱的父亲——	ZSH

306	So have I heard and do in part believe it. But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up; and by my advice   Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.	我这么听说过，也有几分信为真。但看啊，晨曦披着赭红的一口钟，在那高高的东山头踩着露水走；我们这警卫散了吧；你们若同意，让我们把今天夜晚所见的东西告诉少哈姆雷特；凭我的性命，这幽灵，对我们哑口，会对他言语。你们可赞成我们把这事对他说，认为情意不可少，责任应当尽？	SDY

And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	还在这儿，莱阿替斯？上船去，上船去，真好意思！风息在帆篷的肩头上，人家在等你啊。得，我为你祝福！有几句教训你务必铭刻在心。你不要想到什么就说什么，也不要想到什么就做什么。待人要和气，但是决不要随便：相知有素的朋友，考验过交情，就该用钢圈箍上你的灵魂：可不要跟每个半生不熟的相识过分周旋，握粗了你的手掌。当心跟人家吵架，既然吵起来就做到让对手下次碰上你要当心。多听人提意见，少对人发表意见；有批评都接受，自己的判断要保留。口袋里有钱，尽管办贵重衣服，可不要奇装异服；要富丽，避俗艳；要知道穿著往往标明了人品，在法国最有身分的第一流人物特别在穿著上显得最讲究，最大方。才成了成语。不向人借钱，也并不借钱给谁；借出去往往就丢了钱也丢了朋友，借进来会叫你忘记了化钱要省。这一点高于一切——要忠于自己；就如同先有了白昼才会有黑夜。要这样才不会不忠于任何一人。再见：祝你使这番话开花结果！	BZL

I will requite your loves. So, fare you well. Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.	要是它借着我的父王的形貌出现，即使地狱张开嘴来，叫我不要作声，我也一定要对它说话。要是你们到现在还没有把你们所看见的告诉别人，那么我就要请求你们大家继续保持沉默；无论今夜发生什么事情，都请放在心里，不要在口舌之间泄露出去。我一定会报答你们的忠诚。好，再会；今晚十一点钟到十二点钟之间，我要到露台上来看你们。	ZSH

Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	你要是有天性的话，切不可忍受；莫要让堂堂丹麦君王的御床变成可恶的秽乱淫蒸的卧榻。可是，不管你怎样进行这件事，不要玷污了你的心地，也不可策划去伤害你母亲：将她交天谴，她自有生长在她胸中的荆棘去惩创刺螫她。此刻就和你作别！萤火虫显得黎明已近在眼前，它那无力的微芒已渐渐暗淡；再会，再会，再会！要把我记心上。[下。	SDY

I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me? Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again. What may this mean   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

292	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我能；至少私下里这么样传闻。我们的先王，他那神容只刚才对我们显过形，你们知道，被挪威王福丁勃拉思，野心争胜的狂妄自大煽动他，挑战作决斗；英武的哈姆雷特——我们这半边天下谁对他不钦仰——便斩了福丁勃拉思；凭合同文书，跟法律，也跟纹章院规条很符合，他连同性命，把他所有的土地全部输给了比武决斗的得胜者；跟那份土地正相当，我们的先王押下同样多的地作赌注；这会归福丁勃拉思所有，如果他得胜；就凭契约，以及这条款所规定，前面已说过，哈姆雷特就有了他那片土地。如今小福丁勃拉思，年少气盛火性烈，没经受世故，已经在挪威边境上，这里那里，啸聚了一伙刁悍的亡命之徒，供他们吃喝，要他们去干些行险、侥幸的横心泼胆事；那便不外是——对我们邦国的当政显得很清楚——想用强暴的手段，以动武的态势，从我们这里收回那些他父亲已失去的土地。这个，据我看来，是我们准备频繁的主要因由，我们这警卫的缘故，以及到处急匆匆、纷忙动乱的根本所以然。	SDY
