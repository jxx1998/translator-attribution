158	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	你自己就把钥匙收下来保管吧。	BZL
563	Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	不，你是我的好朋友；我愿意和你朋友相称。你怎么不在维滕贝格，霍拉旭？马西勒斯！	ZSH
441	Have after. To what issue wail this come?	跟上去。——这可要弄成什么结局？	SDY
43	See, it stalks away!	看，大踏步走了！	BZL
612	I will watch to-night. Perchance 'twill walk again.	我今晚也要守夜去；也许它还会出来。	ZSH
271	Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one-	就在昨天夜里，那时节北极星西首的那颗星儿正好行过去照耀西天的那一方，它如今正在那边亮，马帅勒史和我，刚正敲一点钟——	SDY
182	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的；可是我虽然在这里从小看惯了，却以为这一种风俗，与其遵守它不如破坏它倒来得体面一点。这样的酗酒纵乐使我们受够了东西各国纷纷的议论和低毁；他们叫我们酒鬼，用瘟猪一类话糟蹋了我们的名号：这一种行径也真要抵消了我们的丰功伟业，至少使我们失去了荣誉的精髓了。就个人说来情形也往往如此，有些人品性上有一点小小的暇疵，或者是天生的（那也怪不得他们，因为天性并不能自己作主），或者是由于某一种特殊的气质过分发展到超出了理性的范围，或者是由于养成了一种习惯，过分要一举一动都讨人喜欢，这些人就带了一种缺点的烙印（天然的符号或者是命运的标记），使他们另外的品质（尽管圣桔，尽管多到一个人担当不了，）也就不免在一般的非议中沾染了这个缺点的溃烂症。一点点毛病往往就抵消了一切高贵的品质，害得人声名狼藉。	BZL

475	He.	正是。	ZSH
543	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?	你父亲已经答应你了吗？波洛尼厄斯怎么说？	ZSH
557	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	啊，那才是一句有孝心的答复；你将在丹麦享有和我同等的尊荣。御妻，来。哈姆雷特这一种自动的顺从使我非常高兴；为了表示庆祝，今天丹麦王每一次举杯祝饮的时候，都要放一响高入云霄的祝炮，让上天应和着地上的雷鸣，发出欢乐的回声。来。[除哈姆雷特外均下]	ZSH
530	We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	它走了！我们不该用暴力对待这样一个尊严的亡魂；因为它是像空气一样不可侵害的。我们无益的打击不过是恶意的徒劳。	ZSH
396	Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well What I have said to you.	再会了，莪斐丽亚；要好好记住我对你说的话。	SDY
622	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	对于哈姆雷特和他的调情献媚，你必须把它认作年轻人一时的感情冲动，一朵初春的紫罗兰，早熟而易凋，馥郁而不能持久，一分钟的芬芳和喜悦，如此而已。	ZSH

Come away.	哎也，这是个亲和、美好的回答：在丹麦跟我们一个样。来吧，贤妻；哈姆雷特这一下允诺，和蔼而语出衷肠，对着我的心在微笑；为表示祝贺，今天丹麦王每一觞欢饮都要有大炮向云天报响，天上将遍传地上君王的畅饮，一声声应和着地上的宏雷。去来。	SDY
376	It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd.	正如我见到他生前那样，玄色里夹些银丝。	SDY
433	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other, horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? Think of it. The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.	它引您去到了海里怎么办，殿下，或者去登上可怕的悬崖绝顶，孤悬的岩壁俯瞰着碧深深的海，那里它露出另一副骇人的形相，那也许就会夺去您理智的均衡，使您发疯，那又怎么办？想一下；没有其他的因由，那地方本身就会叫人起浑不顾一切的怪想，只要他俯对那么多噚下的海水，听它在下面呼啸。	SDY
538	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然我们亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特新丧未久，我们的心里应当充满了悲痛，我们全国都应当表示一致的哀悼，可是我们凛于后死者责任的重大，不能不违情逆性，一方面固然要用适度的悲哀纪念他，一方面也要为自身的利害着想；所以，在一种悲喜交集的情绪之下，让幸福和忧郁分据了我的两眼，殡葬的挽歌和结婚的笙乐同时并奏，用盛大的喜乐抵消沉重的不幸，我已经和我旧日的长嫂，当今的王后，这一个多事之国的共同的统治者，结为夫妇；这一次婚姻事先曾经征求各位的意见，多承你们诚意的赞助，这是我必须向大家致谢的。现在我要让你们知道，年轻的福丁布拉斯看轻了我们的实力，也许他以为自从我们亲爱的王兄驾崩以后，我们的国家已经瓦解，所以挟着他的从中取利的梦想，不断向我们书画要求把他的父亲依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的土地归还。这是他一方面的话。现在要讲到我们的态度和今天召集各位来此的目的。我们的对策是这样的：我这儿已经写好了一封信给挪威国王，年轻的福丁布拉斯的叔父，他因为卧病在床，不曾与闻他侄子的企图，在信里我请他注意他的侄子擅自在国内征募壮丁，训练士卒，积极进行各种准备的事实，要求他从速制止他的进一步的行动；现在我就派遣你，考尼律斯，还有你，伏提曼德，替我把这封信送给挪威老王，除了训令上所规定的条件以外，你们不得僭用你们的权力，和挪威成立逾越范围的妥协。你们赶紧就去吧，再会！	ZSH

516	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正像你就是你自己一样。它身上的那副战铠，正是他讨伐野心的挪威王的时候所穿的；它脸上的那副怒容，活像他有一次和敌人谈判决裂以后，把那些乘雪车的波兰人打倒在冰上的时候的神气，怪事怪事！	ZSH
375	His beard was grizzled- no?	他须髯是灰的不？	SDY
304	And then it started, like a guilty thing   Upon a fearful summons. I have heard The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine; and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	它就像是个有罪的犯人一般，听到可怕的召唤而一惊。我听说公鸡，它是替早晨报晓的号角手，一阵阵啼响它高亢峻峭的喉咙，把白日的神灵唤醒；一经它警告不论在海里火里，在地下或空中，每一个游灵野魅便自会慌忙赶回它的本界；刚才所见的东西便可以证明这句话说得不假。	SDY
97	A truant disposition, good my lord.	无非是因为偷懒，爱逃学，殿下。	BZL
62	Tis here!	在这儿！	BZL
272	Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!	噤声！莫讲了；您瞧，它又在来了！	SDY

283	Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!	站住了！说话，说话！命令你，说话！	SDY
519	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来。谁要是知道的，请告诉我，为什么我们要有这样森严的戒备，使全国的军民每夜不得安息；为什么每天都在制造铜炮，还要向国外购买战具；为什么赶造这许多船只，连星期日也不停止工作；这样夜以继日地辛苦忙碌，究竟为了什么？谁能告诉我？	ZSH
178	No, it is struck.	不，已经敲过了。	BZL
625	I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.	我将要记住你这个很好的教训，让它看守着我的心。可是，我的好哥哥，你不要像有些坏牧师一样，指点我上天去的险峻的荆棘之途，自己却在花街柳巷流连忘返，忘记了自己的箴言。	ZSH
420	The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.	君王今晚上准备着彻夜行觞，要纵酒逞欢，再加上喧闹的狂舞；他每干一樽莱茵美酒的当儿，铜鼓和军号便这么嗥啸出一阵他祝酒的豪兴。	SDY
58	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),   The cock crows. Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!	莫非你生前在地下哪一个角落里埋下了你一生搜刮得来的财宝，因此，据说，人死后还要出鬼的，〔鸡啼。说出来！别走，说！拦住它，玛塞勒斯！	BZL
634	Farewell.Exit.	再会！[下]	ZSH
209	My hour is almost come, When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.	我的时间快到了，我必须马上再回到琉璜的烈火里去受尽熬炼。	BZL
591	Both [and Ber.] We do, my lord.	是，殿下。	ZSH
288	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正好跟你像你自己一个样：他当年正是披戴着这一身盔甲，对野心的挪威国王单身去决斗；有一次也曾这样怒冲冲，谈判时给激怒，他斫冰上乘橇的波兰王。真是奇怪。	SDY
47	Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. 	老天爷在上，要不是我身历其境，亲眼看见，证明是千真万确，我怎么也不会相信。	BZL

332	I am glad to see you well. Horatio!- or I do forget myself.	见到你我很高兴。霍瑞旭，——要是不然，我忘记了自己。	SDY
290	In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	我可不知道该作怎样的想法；不过就我所看到的大体来说，这预兆对于邦国有惊人的动荡。	SDY
284	Tis gone and will not answer.	它走了，不肯答话。	SDY
25	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?	怎样，那东西今晚上可又出现了？	BZL
545	Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-	好好利用你的时间，雷欧提斯，尽情发挥你的才能吧！可是，来，我的侄儿哈姆雷特，我的孩子——	ZSH
680	Heaven will direct it.	上帝的旨意支配一切。	ZSH
197	My fate cries out And makes each petty artire in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.[Ghost beckons.]   Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!- I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.	我的命运在呼唤，它使我身上的每一条微细的血管都变得象尼缅狮子的筋络样繃硬。它还在叫我。你们快放手，朋友；（挣脱。（鬼魂招手我发誓，谁还要挡住我，我叫他变鬼！小心，走开！——走吧；我一路跟来。（鬼魂与哈姆雷特下。	BZL

35	In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  	一模一样，正象我们的先王。	BZL
409	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	是啊，捕捉傻山鹬的罗网。我知道，当欲火熏蒸的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头滥发盟誓；这些发光焰，女儿，光多于热，一烧亮就熄灭，正在答应时，跟正在烧亮时一样，你切勿把它们当火。从今往后要少露你那闺女的声色于他；将你的会晤要看得比一声传令去面谈更值价。对哈姆雷特殿下，要信任他到这一步，就是他年纪还轻，他可以行动自由的限度比你大得多：干脆说，莪斐丽亚，别信他的盟誓；它们穿针引线，不是它们的衣裳所显示的颜色，而只是追求调情打趣的坏家伙，气息倒像是假装圣洁的臭虔婆，为的是更好欺骗人。归总一句话：讲得简单明了些，从现在开始，我不准你随便糟蹋片刻的闲暇，再去跟哈姆雷特殿下说甚话。要好生注意，关照你：来吧。	SDY
154	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	父亲在上，孩儿就此告辞了。	BZL
405	Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly, Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.	我来教你吧：把你自己当娃娃，你竟把这些献出当真正的付款，它们可不是纹银。显出你自己多值些钱吧；否则——且不叫这句话跑伤气，这么说——你显出自己是傻瓜。	SDY
84	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样当孝子，居丧尽哀，足见你天性纯笃，大可称道，但是须知你父亲失去过父亲，那个父亲也曾失去过父亲，后死者要克尽孝道，自然要哀悼一个时期。但是漫无止境，哀毁逾恒，却正是不够孝顺的一种行径，不够堂堂男子气；这反而表现出意志是逆天背理，心是经不起磨练，性情是暴躁，头脑是十分简单，毫无修养。既然我们知道是无可避免的，而且同家常便饭一样的普通，为什么我们要赌气，老记在心上呢？咦！这种行径是违反了上天，违反了死者，违反了人情世故，最蛮不讲理，全不管丁忧丧父在理性是看作常事的，全不管理性就从第一遭变故直喊到如今：“这是不可避免的！”我请你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；我要全世界知道你是我的王位的最直接继承人；最好的慈父怎样用最大的慈爱对待儿子，我就怎样对待你，决不比他差一分。至于你想要回到威登堡大学去继续读书，这种想法是最不合我的意思的；我请你、一定要勉强你、留在这里，使满朝欣慰，当我的第一名重臣，不愧为王上的爱侄，王上的宠儿。	BZL
583	Two nights together had these gentlemen (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch In the dead vast and middle of the night Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位朋友，马西勒斯和勃那多，在万籁俱寂的午夜守望的时候，曾经连续两夜看见一个自顶至踵全身甲胄，像您父亲一样的人形，在他们的面前出现，用庄严而缓慢的步伐走过他们的身边。在他们惊奇骇愕的眼前，它三次走过去，它手里所握的鞭杖可以碰到他们的身上；他们吓得几乎浑身都瘫痪了，只是呆立着不动，一句话也没有对它说。怀着惴惧的心情，他们把这件事悄悄地告诉了我，我就在第三夜陪着他们一起守望；正像他们所说的一样，那鬼魂又出现了，出现的时间和他的形状，证实了他们的每一个字都是正确的。我认识您的父亲，那鬼魂是那样酷肖他的生前，我这两手也不及他们彼此的相似。	ZSH
555	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	不要让你母亲的祈求全归无用，哈姆雷特；请你不要离开我们，不要到维滕贝格去。	ZSH
644	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	而且，父亲，他差不多用尽一切指天誓日的神圣的盟约，证实他的言语。	ZSH
87	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply. Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come. This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.	这样回答才真是有头脑，能体贴！你留在丹麦就和我不分彼此吧。夫人，来吧。我听了哈姆雷特这样子惠然允诺，高兴得心都笑了：为了表示庆祝，今天丹麦王每于一次杯都要放一次大炮，高响入云，叫夭上把欢乐传开去，一声声回应着地上的雷鸣。来吧。	BZL
665	It will not speak. Then will I follow it.	它不肯说话；我还是跟它去。	ZSH
120	Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? Both [and Ber.] We do, my lord.	不错，不错。这可搅得我心乱了。你们今晚上还守夜吗？玛、贝守，殿下。	BZL
588	Tis very strange.	这很奇怪。	ZSH
44	Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak! Exit Ghost.	别走！说呀，说呀！我命令你说话！（鬼魂下	BZL
101	Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.	的确，婚礼也就紧接着来了。	BZL
462	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看你容易激发；你要是对这件事情不采取行动，那就比遗忘川夹岸臭烂的莠草更要迟钝了。听我说，哈姆雷特：据他们宣称，我在御花园里睡觉，有条蛇螫了我；全丹麦人的耳朵就误被这个捏造的我的死因卑劣地蒙骗住：可是你，年轻有为，要知道那条螫死你父亲的毒虺现在正戴着王冠。	SDY
636	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 	回父亲的话，我们刚才谈起哈姆雷特殿下的事情。	ZSH
364	What, look'd he frowningly.	怎么！他可是蹙着眉头吗？	SDY
560	Hail to your lordship!	祝福，殿下！	ZSH
486	Give you good night.	祝你们晚安！	ZSH
107	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	殿下，我昨夜好象又看见了他。	BZL
150	For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	一个人成长，并非是只长筋肉，只长躯体；这一副架子扩大了，内心活动要求的香花供奉也就增加了，也许他现在是爱你的，现在还没有龌龊的心机糟蹋他纯洁的愿望：可是你必须留心：地位太高，一想到就不能由自己作得了主意；他得受身分的拘束。他倒不可能，就象普通人一样的，自己挑选，因为他选对了没有都会影响到国家的安危隆替；他是国家的首脑，他的选择就必须先得到国家的同意和批准。所以，如果你听到他对你说他爱你，你不该轻易听信，你得认清楚：照他的身分行事，他究竟有几分说得到做得到；他怎样也不能跳出决定一切的丹麦王许可的限度。如果你耳根太软，听他的花腔迷了心，对他冒失的苦苦哀求打开了贞洁的宝藏，你可以想一想你的名誉会受到多大的损失。当心啊，莪菲丽亚，当心啊，亲爱的妹妹，你要尽可能留在你感情的后方，避开欲望能袭击的危险范围。一位小心的姑娘，如果对月亮敞开了自己的美丽，就算够放浪了；守身加工还难免受诽谤打击；春天的嫩苗还没有开花放苞，毛虫就往往钻进去把它咬伤；青春年少、朝露晶洼的时候，发瘟的风霜随时会摧残到头上。所以要小心啊；随时警惕最安全：不煽动，青春也就会对自己造反。	BZL
662	It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	它招手叫您跟着它去，好像它有什么话要对您一个人说似的。	ZSH

What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	现在，雷欧提斯，你有什么话说？你对我说你有一个请求；是什么请求，雷欧提斯？只要是合理的事情，你向丹麦王说了，他总不会不答应你。你有什么要求，雷欧提斯，不是你未开口我就自动许给了你？丹麦王室和你父亲的关系，正像头脑之于心灵一样密切；丹麦国王乐意为你父亲效劳，正像嘴里所说的话，可以由双手去执行一样。你要些什么，雷欧提斯？	ZSH
691	So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	你听了以后，必须替我报仇。	ZSH

'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看出你是积极的；你如果对这件事情不采取行动，就比忘川河岸上懒坏的水草还要迟钝了。得，哈姆雷特，听我说。人家宣布说，我在花园里睡觉，一条蛇把我咬了。这一个虚构的死因，恶毒万分，把丹麦全国的听闻一手遮掩了。可是你，高贵的青年，要知道那一条咬死你父亲的毒蛇现在就戴了王冠。怪不得我先恨啊！	BZL

The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我们也深信无疑：祝两位顺遂。现在，赉候底施，你可有什么事？你曾说有请求；要怎样，赉候底施？你不会对丹麦当今请求得有理，而将话白说；什么事，赉候底施，你有所要求，我不会给你满足？头脑不会跟心儿更加相一致，这只手不会跟这张嘴起到作用，比较丹麦的当今对于你父亲。你有何要求，赉候底施？	SDY

That it should come to this! But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太太结实的肉体（众下，仅留哈姆雷特。融了，解了，化成了一片露水；但愿天经地义并没有一条严禁自杀的戒律！上帝啊！上帝啊！我觉得人世间醉生梦死的一套是多么无聊，乏味，无一是处！呔！呔！这是个荒废的花园，一天天零落；生性芜秽的蔓草全把它占据了。居然有这等事情！才死了两个月！不，还不到两个月。这样好一位国王，比起这一位简直是海庇亮比萨徒；对我的母亲又这样恩爱，简直不容许天风吹痛了她的脸庞。上天下地！定要我记住吗？当日啊，她依他傍他，仿佛是越尝滋味越开了胃口；然而，还不出一个月——我简直不敢想！脆弱啊，你的名字就叫女人！——短短一个月，她象泪人儿一样纷我父亲送葬去穿的鞋子还一点都没有穿旧呢，哎呀，你看她，（无知的畜生也还会哀痛得久一点呢！）她居然就同我的叔父结婚了；我这个叔父可绝不象他的哥哥，正如我不象赫勾列啊！还不出一个月，不等她假仁假义的眼泪干了，不等她热辣的眼睛消去了红肿，她就结婚了。赶急得真是作孽啊，这样轻捷的钻进了乱他的衾被！	BZL

'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	哈姆雷特，你这样孝思不匮，原是你天性中纯笃过人之处；可是你要知道，你的父亲也曾失去过一个父亲，那失去的父亲自己也失去过父亲；那后死的儿子为了尽他的孝道，必须有一个时期服丧守制，然而固执不变的哀伤，却是一种逆天悖理的愚行，不是堂堂男子所应有的举动；它表现出一个不肯安于天命的意志，一个经不起艰难痛苦的心，一个缺少忍耐的头脑和一个简单愚昧的理性。既然我们知道那是无可避免的事，无论谁都要遭遇到同样的经验，那么我们为什么要这样固执地把它介意于怀呢？嘿！那是对上天的罪戾，对死者的罪戾，也是违反人情的罪戾；在理智上它是完全荒谬的，因为从第一个死了的父亲起，直到今天死去的最后一个父亲为止，理智永远在呼喊：“这是无可避免的。”我请你抛弃了这种无益的悲伤，把我当作你的父亲；因为我要让全世界知道，你是王位直接的继承者，我要给你尊荣和恩宠，不亚于一个最慈爱的父亲之于他的儿子。至于你要回到维滕贝格去继续求学的意思，那是完全违反我们的愿望的；请你听从我的劝告，不要离开这里，在朝廷上领袖群臣，做我们最亲近的国亲和王子，使我们因为每天能够看见你而感到欢欣。	ZSH

553	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好像，母亲！不，是这样就是这样，我不知道什么“好像”不“好像”。好妈妈，我的墨黑的外套，礼俗上规定的丧服，勉强吐出来的叹气，像滚滚江流一样的眼泪，悲苦沮丧的脸色，以及一切仪式、外表和忧伤的流露，都不能表示出我的真实的情绪。这些才真是给人瞧的，因为谁都可以做作成这种样子。它们不过是悲哀的装饰和衣服；可是我郁结的心事却无法表现出来的。	ZSH

699	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我的话果然激动了你；要是你听见了这种事情而漠然无动于衷，那你除非比疏散在忘河之滨的蔓草还要冥顽不灵。现在，哈姆雷特，听我说；一般人都以为我在花园里睡觉的时候，一条蛇来把我螫死，这一个虚构的死状，把丹麦全国的人都骗过了；可是你要知道，好孩子，那毒害你父亲的蛇，头上戴着王冠呢。	ZSH

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, 	我可以；至少传说是如此，先王陛下，刚才还仿佛露过了一下子脸呢，当年碰上了挪威王福丁布拉斯骄矜好胜，一定要前来挑战，你们都知道的；我们英武的哈姆雷特是举世闻名的，就在一场决斗中杀死了福丁布拉斯，事先有协定，双方批准，还郑重宣布过公约，败者结果是不但断送了性命而且把所有的土地送给了胜者。先玉当然也提出过相当的土地押了注：要是福丁布拉斯得胜呢，这部分土地也就归他所有，正如协定中同一款明文规定的、他要是失败，就得把所有的土地转送给哈姆雷特。如今小福丁布拉斯狙气方刚，还不知天高地厚，已经在挪威边境，东一处西一处，招聚了一批没有土地的亡命徒，管他们吃喝，要他们大举出动尝一尝冒险的滋味；用意所在，我们的当局看得清清楚楚，无非是要用武力和强迫手段。	BZL

223	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是那一个通奸乱伦的禽兽，就凭他诡计多端，花样百出，（邪恶的才智啊，这样子有本事诱骗人！）为了满足他极端无耻的兽欲，骗上了我那位最显得贞洁的王后。啊，哈姆雷特，这是怎样的堕落啊，不管我的爱情是这样庄严。完全匹配了我跟她结婚的盟誓，竟至于屈尊就教这一个坏蛋，不看他天赋的才德比我的要低不知多少倍！贞操，尽管让淫欲扮做了天仙前来求爱，也永远不为所动，色情，尽管跟光华的天使结了婚，也会厌弃了至尊极乐的天床吃人家垃圾。慢一点！我好象闻到了早晨的气息；我说得简单些。我在花园里睡觉，我每天午后照例要这样歇一下，想不到你的叔父竟乘我不备，溜进来，用了一小瓶该死的乌木汁，把我的两只耳朵一齐都灌了。这一种麻疯式毒精跟人的血液死不两立，会马上就发作起来，滴溜溜象水银一样，无孔不入，一下子通遍了全身的大门小径，力道猛极了，象酸液滴进了牛奶，一下子把全身鲜活流畅的血液都凝结起来。我的血液就这样了；而且立刻有无数的疹泡，麻疯样，带着可怕的疤片，盖住了我全身光滑的皮肤。我就这样在睡梦中由一个弟兄一下子夺去了生命，王冠，王后！就在罪孽深重里一命归天，来不及举行圣餐礼，忏悔，涂膏，来不及结一结清楚，就叫我算了帐，不管我满头是未清未净的红尘。	BZL

A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位士子，马帅勒史和剖那陀，一连两个夜晚在他们警卫时，在宵深夜里、死一般冥寂之中，他们碰上了。先王般的一个形象，从头到脚，全副的披挂簇崭齐，在他们面前现形，用庄严的步伐缓慢而威灵地走过他们：他三回走过他们惊骇得欲绝的眼前，跟他们相差不到他一权杖之隔；他们害怕得几乎化成了肉冻，站着像哑巴，不敢对他去开腔。他们把这事惴悚悚秘密告诉我；第三夜我和他们一同去守卫；在那里，正如他们所说的，时间也对，模样也对，每句话都证实，那鬼魂又来了。我认识殿下的父王；这两只手不能更像。	SDY

Yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanish'd from our sight.	殿下，我说了，可是它没有回答我；不过有一次我觉得它好像抬起头来，像要开口说话似的，可是就在那个时候，晨鸡高声啼了起来，它一听见鸡声，就很快地隐去不见了。	ZSH

423	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	是的，凭圣处女：不过在我看来，我虽然在本地生长，日常已见惯，这可是个习俗，遵守它倒不如破坏它更加光荣。这样的酗酒耽乐使我们备受东西诸邦一体的讥讪和责骂；他们叫我们醉鬼，用泥猪那类话玷污我们的称号；那么着也就当真消减了我们丰伟的勋业，把我们声望里的精华、真髓抽去。所以，往往在有些个人身上，因他们本来有某种天生的缺陷，与生俱来，——那可怪不得他们，既然生命不可能自己去选来历——由于某一种性癖有过度的滋长，时常冲破了理性的藩篱与堡砦，或者有什么习惯过于发扬了令人爱的心性形态；却说这些人——他们沾上了那种缺陷的印记，那缺陷，不出于天然，即肇自命运——他们其他的美德，即令清纯得了不起，即令没涘涯，非凡人所能有，将在世人的见解中，因那个缺失而遭到毁伤败坏；一些些乖舛会招致对整个高贵品质的狐疑，使声名狼藉。	SDY

All that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.  	好哈姆雷特，脱下你的黑衣，对你的父王应该和颜悦色一点；不要老是垂下了眼皮，在泥土之中找寻你的高贵的父亲。你知道这是一件很普通的事情，活着的人谁都要死去，从生存的空间踏进了永久的宁静。	ZSH

66	It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long; And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad, The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.	刚才它真是一听到鸡叫就隐去了。有人说，每逢我们要庆祝圣诞，在节日前几天，这种报晓的家禽就开始彻夜不停的啼了又啼；那时候，他们说，精灵部不敢出来。夜夜安全，星宿不作怪、害人，妖女不迷人，妖巫也使不了符咒，那真是圣洁、祥和的好时候，好节气。	BZL

Tender yourself more dearly, Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.	我教你想吧：你是个三岁小孩，随他“捧”出来什么，都当是真东西！你该把自己的身价“捧”得高一点，（可怜这小字眼跑野马要跑断气了）当心你给我“捧”出来一个小傻瓜！	BZL

522	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.	那是扰乱我们心灵之眼的一点微尘。从前在富强繁盛的罗马，当那雄才大略的尤利乌斯·恺撒驾崩以前不久的时候，披着殓衾的死人都从坟墓里走出来，在街道上啾啾鬼语，拖着火尾、喷着血露的星辰在白昼陨落，支配潮汐的月亮被吞蚀得像一个没有起色的病人；这一类预报重大变故的征兆，在我们国内也已经屡次出现了，可是不要响！瞧！瞧！它又来了！	ZSH

85	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet. I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.	别让你母亲自费唇舌吧，哈姆雷特：我请你别离开我们，别再去威登堡了。	BZL
291	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来，谁知道就请告诉我，为什么要这样严谨、周密的警卫，使海内的臣民每天都彻夜辛勤；为什么要这样日日去铸造铜炮，且又向外邦去购买刀枪和火药；为什么要这样征用造船的工匠，他们得终周劳苦，礼拜天也不歇；有什么事情会发生，叫人要这么汗流浃背，日夜忙急得没安息：谁能告诉我这件事？	SDY

71	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	至亲的先兄哈姆雷特驾崩未久，记忆犹新，大家固然是应当哀戚于心，应该让全国上下愁眉不展，共结成一片哀容，然而理智和感情交战的结果，我们就一边用适当的哀思悼念他。一边也不忘记我们自己的本分。因此，仿佛抱昔中作乐的心情，仿佛一只眼含笑，一只眼流泪，仿佛使殡丧同喜庆歌哭相和，使悲喜成半斤八两，彼此相应，我已同昔日的长嫂，当今的新后，承袭我邦家大业的先王德配，结为夫妇：事先也多方听取了各位的高见，多承一致拥护，一切顺利；为此，特申谢意。如今，各位知道的，小福丁布拉斯，少年气盛，小看了我们的力量，或者妄以为先兄一朝弃世，我们的国家忽然脱了节，脱了榫，单凭了自以为有机可乘的梦想。他就一再送文书前来烦读，要求我们归还他父亲的失地，全不管那些土地是依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的。别再讲他了。现在转回来讲我们这次的会议。事情是这样：我有国书一封写好在此，预备送挪威国王，小福了布拉斯的叔父，他老病经年，卧床不起，并不知悉他侄儿在国内招兵买马，用意何在，因此就请他从速制止他侄儿进一步有所行动。我特此遣派你，考奈留斯，还有你，伏尔第曼德，当这次通问挪威玉国的信使，但是你们和国王进行交涉、不得越权，不得擅自超出了这些训令所明白规定的范围。再见吧！愿速去速回，以表忠诚。考、伏赴汤蹈火，一切定当效命。	BZL

170	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	捕捉傻鹁鸪的天罗地网！我知道，欲火上升的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头乱发誓言的。这种火，小丫头，要知道，是光多于热，都不过一现，刚刚发出来，一下子就热退光消了，你千万别当作是真火。从今以后多注意你千金身分，少出头露面吧。你要高高在上，别一听呼召便移樽就教。对于哈姆雷特殿下，你应该明白这一点：他还年轻，而且他可以自由活动的场面比你的广得多。总而言之，莪菲丽亚，别相信他的盟誓；那是牵线人，身上穿的衣裳是洁白，干净，心里转的念头是卑鄙，龊龊，就象龟婆冒充圣徒，假正经，为了更便于骗人。干脆一句话，从今以后，哪怕是片刻的闲工夫我都不准你这样子随便糟蹋、再后来跟哈姆雷特殿下说话！好好留神，我要你记住。来吧。	BZL

549	Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.	不，陛下，我已经在太阳里晒得太久了。	ZSH
642	My lord, he hath importun'd me with love In honourable fashion.	父亲，他向我求爱的态度是很光明正大的。	ZSH
624	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	不过如此；因为像新月一样逐渐饱满的人生，不仅是肌肉和体格的成长，而且随着身体的发展，精神和心灵也同时扩大。也许他现在爱你，他的真诚的意志是纯洁而不带欺诈的；可是你必须留心，他有这样高的地位，他的意志并不属于他自己，因为他自己也要被他的血统所支配；他不能像一般庶民一样为自己选择，因为他的决定足以影响到整个国家的安危，他是全身的首脑，他的选择必须得到各部分肢体的同意；所以要是他说，他爱你，你不可贸然相信，应该明白：照他的身份地位来说，他要想把自己的话付诸实现，绝不能越出丹麦国内普遍舆论所同意的范围。你再想一想，要是你用过于轻信的耳朵倾听他的歌曲，让他攫走了你的心，在他的狂妄的渎求之下，打开了你的宝贵的童贞，那时候你的名誉将要蒙受多大的损失。留心，奥菲利娅，留心，我的亲爱的妹妹，不要放纵你的爱情，不要让欲望的利箭把你射中。一个自爱的女郎不应该向月亮显露她的美貌；圣贤也不能逃避谗口的中伤；春天的草木往往还没有吐放它们的蓓蕾，就被蛀虫蠹蚀；朝露一样晶莹的青春，常常会受到罡风的吹打。所以留心吧，戒惧是最安全的方策；即使没有旁人的诱惑，少年的血气也要向他自己叛变。	ZSH

147	For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting; The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	哈姆雷特对你要好，乱献殷勤，要认清那只是赶时髦，做感情游戏；只是青春里出现的一朵紫罗兰，开得早，谢得快，甜甜的，可不能持久；只供一刹那赏乐的一阵花香：如此而已。	BZL

658	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的。可是我虽然从小就熟习这种风俗，我却以为把它破坏了倒比遵守它还体面些，这一种酗酒纵乐的风俗，使我们在东西各国受到许多非议；他们称我们为酒徒醉汉，将下流的污名加在我们头上，使我们各项伟大的成就都因此而大为减色。在个人方面也常常是这样，有些人因为身体上长了丑恶的黑痣——这本来是天生的缺陷，不是他们自己的过失——或者生就一种令人侧目的怪癖，虽然他们此外还有许多纯洁优美的品性，可是为了这一个缺点，往往会受到世人的歧视。一点丑恶就毁坏了高贵的品质，使人声名狼藉。	ZSH

Break we our watch up; and by my advice   Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? 	我也听人家这样说过，倒有几分相信。可是瞧，清晨披着赤褐色的外衣，已经踏着那边东方高山上的露水走过来了。我们也可以下班了。照我的意思，我们应该把我们今夜看见的事情告诉年轻的哈姆雷特；因为凭着我的生命起誓，这一个鬼魂虽然对我们不发一言，但见了哈姆雷特一定有话要说。你们以为按照我们的忠心和责任说起来，是不是应当让他知道这件事情？	ZSH

701	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	嗯，那个乱伦的奸淫的畜生，他有的是过人的诡诈，天赋的奸恶，凭着他的阴险的手段，诱惑了我的外表上似乎非常贞淑的王后，满足他的无耻的兽欲。啊，哈姆雷特，那是一个多么相去悬殊的差异！我的爱情是那样纯洁真诚，始终信守着我在结婚的时候对她所作的盟誓；她却会对一个天赋的才德远不如我的恶人降心相从！可是正像一个贞洁的女子，虽然淫欲罩上神圣的外表，也不能把她煽动一样，一个淫妇虽然和光明的天使为偶，也会有一天厌倦于天上的唱随之乐，而宁愿搂抱人间的朽骨。可是且慢！我仿佛嗅到了清晨的空气，让我把话说得简短一些，当我按照每天午后的惯例，在花园里睡觉的时候，你的叔父趁我不备，悄悄溜了进来，拿着一个盛着毒草汁的小瓶，把一种使人麻痹的药水注入我的耳腔之内，那药性发作起来，会像水银一样很快地流过全身的大小血管，像酸液滴进牛乳般地把淡薄而健全的血液凝结起来；它一进入我的身体里，我全身光滑的皮肤上便立刻长出无数疱疹，像害着癞病似的满布着可憎的鳞片。这样，我在睡梦之中，被一个兄弟同时夺去了我的生命、我的王冠和我的王后；甚至不给我一个忏罪的机会，使我在没有领到圣餐也没有受过临终涂膏礼时，就一无准备地负着我的全部罪恶去对簿阴曹。可怕啊，可怕！要是你有天性之情，不要默尔而息，不要让丹麦的御寝变成了藏奸养逆的卧榻；可是无论你怎样进行复仇，你的行事必须光明磊落，更不可对你的母亲有什么不利的图谋，她自会受到上天的裁判，和她自己内心中的荆棘的刺戳。现在我必须去了！萤火的微光已经开始暗淡下去，清晨快要到来了；再会，再会！哈姆雷特，记着我。[下]	ZSH

702	O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart! And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables! Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.] So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word: It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'   I have sworn't.	天上的神明啊！地啊！再有什么呢！我还要向地狱呼喊吗？啊，呸！忍着吧，忍着吧，我的心！我的全身的筋骨，不要一下子就变成衰老，支持着我的身体呀！记着你！是的，我可怜的亡魂，当记忆不曾从我这混乱的头脑里消失的时候，我会记着你的。记着你！是的，我要从我的记忆的碑版上，拭去一切琐碎愚蠢的记录、一切书本上的格言、一切陈言套语、一切过去的印象，我的少年的阅历所留下的痕迹，只让你的命令留在我的脑筋的书卷里，不掺杂一些下贱的废料；是的，上天为我做证！啊，最恶毒的妇人！啊，奸贼，奸贼，脸上堆着笑的万恶的奸贼！我的写字板呢？我必须把它记下来：一个人尽管满面都是笑，骨子里却是杀人的奸贼；至少我相信在丹麦是这样的。[写字]好，叔父，我把你写下来了。现在我要记下我的话，那是：“再会，再会！记着我。”我已经发过誓了。	ZSH

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.	这真是搅扰人心眼的一粒尘埃。从前在共和罗马鼎盛的首都，在显赫的恺撒大将遇害前不久，坟墓尽走空，死尸裹着入殓衣，到罗马街头去唧唧啾啾地乱叫；星子拖着火焰尾，露珠里含血水，太阳变惨白；还有那水上的冰轮，奈泼钧的万顷海疆要听它挥运，晦蚀得黯淡无光，像世界末日届；而大劫临头、灾殃下降的朕兆，——如前驱使者们总是先命运而来，祸事将至时必有开场的楔子，——天公和地母都已经上下一起来，把它们向宗邦和万民作过昭示。莫作声，看啊！看那边，它又来了！我中魔也要面对它。站住，幻象！你要是能发出声音，会通达言语，[鬼张臂。]就对我说话：要是有什么好事可以去办了，好叫你安舒，且对我能有荣誉，就对我说话：要是你秘密知晓宗邦的命运，也许我们预先知道了能防避，啊！你就讲；或者你要是在生前用强取得了财宝埋藏在地下哪一处洞窟里，为那个，人家说，你们鬼魂常出现，讲出来：站住了，说话！马帅勒史，拦住它。	SDY

464	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是的，那个通奸乱伦的禽兽就仗那诡诈的迷功，叛逆的本领——啊，邪恶的聪明和才智，这么样会奸骗！——把我这貌似贞洁的王后，诱得满足了他那无耻的淫欲：啊，哈姆雷特，多自甘的下贱哟！我对她的爱是那么精醇可贵，那和我跟她义结百年姻好时所起的信誓完全相符契，而她竟会委身于这样个伧夫，他对我有什么才智来相比！但正如美德，它永远也不会动心，即令浪荡装扮成天仙来求爱，淫欲，尽管跟光艳的天使结了婚，还会在极乐的天床上感到餍足，而要去贪吃臭烂。且住！我好似闻到了早晨的清气；让我简单说。我在御园里偃息，那是我每天经常的习惯要歇晌，你那叔父偷偷地趁着我不备窜进来，手持一瓶恶毒的紫杉汁，把那引发起全身恶癞的毒精灌进了我的耳孔去；那药性一发就跟人周身的血液水火不相容，只顷刻之间，快得和水银相似，它通行无阻，穿门过路处处到，而且它发作快而猛，像醋酸滴进牛奶，把我的稀薄而健全的血液凝敛冻结了起来：我的血便这样；而且顿时立刻有疹疱散布开，像是大麻风，可恨的呕人的恶癞结满我光滑的全身。便这样，我在睡梦中被一个兄弟一下子把生命、王冠、王后都夺去：就在罪孽深重里一命抛黄泉，来不及接受圣餐，作忏悔，涂油膏，不曾能结算，还戴着满头罪孽，就给赶送到上帝跟前去清账。	SDY

So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太凝固的肉体会融化，消解，稀释成一滴露水；但愿永恒的主宰没有制定过禁止人自戮的戒律！上帝啊！上帝！这人间一切的常行惯例对于我显得多可厌，陈腐，乏味和无聊！呸呸！啊，这是个芜秽的荒园，丛生着野草；到处是藜蒿与荆蓁，塞地幔天。竟到这样的地步！才死了两个月！不，还不到两月：恁英明一位君主；比起这个来，犹如太阳神比妖仙；他对我母亲这么样亲爱，简直不容许天风吹打上她的脸庞。天公与地母！定要我回想吗？哎也，她偎依着他，仿佛食进得越多，越发加大了胃口；可是，仅仅在一个月之内，莫让我想起——“脆弱”，你名字叫女人！短短一个月，她和那荷琵一个样，涕泪交横，跟着我父亲去送葬穿的鞋还没有穿旧，她呀，就是她——上帝啊！一头全没有理性的畜生也会哀悼得长久些——跟叔父成了婚，我父亲的兄弟，但毫不跟他相像，正如我不像赫勾理斯：一个月之内，不等她佯悲假痛的眼泪停止流，不等她哭痛的眼睛消退红肿，她就结了婚。啊，慌忙得好棘手，迅捷地匆匆引荐于淫乱的床褥！这不是好事，也决不会有好结果：可是，宁肯心碎吧，我必须住口。	SDY

The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我深信二位的热忱。愿二位珍重！现在，莱阿替斯，你有什么事情呢？你说过有所请求。就说吧，莱阿替斯。丹麦王只要听你说得有理，〔考奈留斯与伏尔弟曼德下。总会答应的。你对我有什么要求还怕不会是未开口先到手，莱阿替斯？丹麦王座对于你的父亲就象头对于心一样的休戚相关，就象手对于嘴一样的乐于效劳。你想要怎样，莱阿替斯？	BZL

In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen. Enter Ghost again. But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion! Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and, race to me, Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!	这是搅得乱心眼的一点灰尘。从前，就在全盛时代的罗马，在雄才盖世的恺撒遇害前不久，坟墓都开了，陈死人裹着入殓衣，都出来到罗马街头啾啾的乱叫；天上星拖着火尾巴，露水带血，太阳发黑：向来是控制大海、支配潮汐的月亮，病容满面，昏沉得好象已经到世界末日。劫数临头、大难将至以前，总会先出现种种不祥的征象，如今天上和地上一齐出动，一再把这一类重大变故的预兆对我们国家和人民显示出来了。鬼魂重上。噢，别作声！看！看它又来了！我着邪也要拦住它！别走，影子！只要是你也会开口，也会用舌头的，对我说话吧！莫非你有什么好事要人家来做，好使你安心，也使我行了功德，对我说说！莫非你预先知道祖国的命运，讲出来也许使我们能避免灾殃，说呀！	BZL

But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，因为生前孽障未尽，被判在晚间游行地上，白昼忍受火焰的烧灼，必须经过相当的时期，等生前的过失被火焰净化以后，方才可以脱罪。可是我不能违犯禁令，泄露我的狱中的秘密，我可以告诉你一个故事，最轻微的几句话都可以使你魂飞魄散，使你年轻的血液凝冻成冰，使你的双眼像脱了轨道的星球一样向前突出，使你的纠结的鬈发根根分开，像愤怒的豪猪身上的刺毛一样森然耸立；可是这一种永恒的神秘，是不能向血肉的凡耳宣示的，听着，听着，啊，听着！要是你曾经爱过你的亲爱的父亲——	ZSH

Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.	我这么听说过，也有几分信为真。但看啊，晨曦披着赭红的一口钟，在那高高的东山头踩着露水走；我们这警卫散了吧；你们若同意，让我们把今天夜晚所见的东西告诉少哈姆雷特；凭我的性命，这幽灵，对我们哑口，会对他言语。你们可赞成我们把这事对他说，认为情意不可少，责任应当尽？	SDY

Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	还在这儿，莱阿替斯？上船去，上船去，真好意思！风息在帆篷的肩头上，人家在等你啊。得，我为你祝福！有几句教训你务必铭刻在心。你不要想到什么就说什么，也不要想到什么就做什么。待人要和气，但是决不要随便：相知有素的朋友，考验过交情，就该用钢圈箍上你的灵魂：可不要跟每个半生不熟的相识过分周旋，握粗了你的手掌。当心跟人家吵架，既然吵起来就做到让对手下次碰上你要当心。多听人提意见，少对人发表意见；有批评都接受，自己的判断要保留。口袋里有钱，尽管办贵重衣服，可不要奇装异服；要富丽，避俗艳；要知道穿著往往标明了人品，在法国最有身分的第一流人物特别在穿著上显得最讲究，最大方。才成了成语。不向人借钱，也并不借钱给谁；借出去往往就丢了钱也丢了朋友，借进来会叫你忘记了化钱要省。这一点高于一切——要忠于自己；就如同先有了白昼才会有黑夜。要这样才不会不忠于任何一人。再见：祝你使这番话开花结果！	BZL

Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again. What may this mean   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

292	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我能；至少私下里这么样传闻。我们的先王，他那神容只刚才对我们显过形，你们知道，被挪威王福丁勃拉思，野心争胜的狂妄自大煽动他，挑战作决斗；英武的哈姆雷特——我们这半边天下谁对他不钦仰——便斩了福丁勃拉思；凭合同文书，跟法律，也跟纹章院规条很符合，他连同性命，把他所有的土地全部输给了比武决斗的得胜者；跟那份土地正相当，我们的先王押下同样多的地作赌注；这会归福丁勃拉思所有，如果他得胜；就凭契约，以及这条款所规定，前面已说过，哈姆雷特就有了他那片土地。如今小福丁勃拉思，年少气盛火性烈，没经受世故，已经在挪威边境上，这里那里，啸聚了一伙刁悍的亡命之徒，供他们吃喝，要他们去干些行险、侥幸的横心泼胆事；那便不外是——对我们邦国的当政显得很清楚——想用强暴的手段，以动武的态势，从我们这里收回那些他父亲已失去的土地。这个，据我看来，是我们准备频繁的主要因由，我们这警卫的缘故，以及到处急匆匆、纷忙动乱的根本所以然。	SDY

150	For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	一个人成长，并非是只长筋肉，只长躯体；这一副架子扩大了，内心活动要求的香花供奉也就增加了，也许他现在是爱你的，现在还没有龌龊的心机糟蹋他纯洁的愿望：可是你必须留心：地位太高，一想到就不能由自己作得了主意；他得受身分的拘束。他倒不可能，就象普通人一样的，自己挑选，因为他选对了没有都会影响到国家的安危隆替；他是国家的首脑，他的选择就必须先得到国家的同意和批准。所以，如果你听到他对你说他爱你，你不该轻易听信，你得认清楚：照他的身分行事，他究竟有几分说得到做得到；他怎样也不能跳出决定一切的丹麦王许可的限度。如果你耳根太软，听他的花腔迷了心，对他冒失的苦苦哀求打开了贞洁的宝藏，你可以想一想你的名誉会受到多大的损失。当心啊，莪菲丽亚，当心啊，亲爱的妹妹，你要尽可能留在你感情的后方，避开欲望能袭击的危险范围。一位小心的姑娘，如果对月亮敞开了自己的美丽，就算够放浪了；守身加工还难免受诽谤打击；春天的嫩苗还没有开花放苞，毛虫就往往钻进去把它咬伤；青春年少、朝露晶洼的时候，发瘟的风霜随时会摧残到头上。所以要小心啊；随时警惕最安全：不煽动，青春也就会对自己造反。	BZL
1694	Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia.   Her father and myself (lawful espials) Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him, as he is behav'd, If't be th' affliction of his love, or no, That thus he suffers for.	亲爱的格特鲁德，你也暂时离开我们；因为我们已经暗中差人去唤哈姆雷特到这儿来，让他和奥菲利娅见见面，就像他们偶然相遇一般。她的父亲跟我两人将要权充一下密探，躲在可以看见他们，却不能被他们看见的地方，注意他们会面的情形，从他的行为上判断他的疯病究竟是不是因为恋爱上的苦闷。	ZSH

Yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanish'd from our sight.	殿下，我说了；可是它并不回答。我似乎看见它终于抬起头来，一举一动显得它分明是就要开口说话了：可是报晓的公鸡就大声啼了，一听见这个声音，它就一缩，马上就隐去不见了。	BZL

What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.	让我代你们说明来意，免得你们泄露了自己的秘密，有负国王王后的托付。我近来不知为了什么缘故，一点兴致都提不起来，什么游乐的事都懒得过问；在这一种抑郁的心境之下，仿佛负载万物的大地，这一座美好的框架，只是一个不毛的荒岬，这个覆盖众生的苍穹，这一顶壮丽的帷幕，这个点缀着金黄色的火球的庄严的屋子，只是一大堆污浊的瘴气的集合。人类是一件多么了不得的杰作！多么高贵的理性！多么伟大的力量！多么优美的仪表！多么文雅的举动！在行为上多么像一个天使！在智慧上多么像一个天神！宇宙的精华！万物的灵长！可是在我看来，这一个泥土塑成的生命算得了什么？人类不能使我发生兴趣；不，女人也不能使我发生兴趣，虽然从你的微笑之中，我可以看到你的异议。	ZSH

Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, 	我可以；至少传说是如此，先王陛下，刚才还仿佛露过了一下子脸呢，当年碰上了挪威王福丁布拉斯骄矜好胜，一定要前来挑战，你们都知道的；我们英武的哈姆雷特是举世闻名的，就在一场决斗中杀死了福丁布拉斯，事先有协定，双方批准，还郑重宣布过公约，败者结果是不但断送了性命而且把所有的土地送给了胜者。先玉当然也提出过相当的土地押了注：要是福丁布拉斯得胜呢，这部分土地也就归他所有，正如协定中同一款明文规定的、他要是失败，就得把所有的土地转送给哈姆雷特。如今小福丁布拉斯狙气方刚，还不知天高地厚，已经在挪威边境，东一处西一处，招聚了一批没有土地的亡命徒，管他们吃喝，要他们大举出动尝一尝冒险的滋味；用意所在，我们的当局看得清清楚楚，无非是要用武力和强迫手段。	BZL

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.	讲这段台词，我请你要照我刚才念给你听的那样，从舌尖上的溜溜滚出来：可是你若用装腔的大嗓子讲，像你们好些个伶工那样，我宁愿叫宣读告示的公差来讲我的词儿，也莫把手老在空中拉锯，这样；而是要表演得平和温顺；因为在你那热情的激流，风暴，甚至，我可以说，旋风之中，你应当力求做到中和稳静，才能把它温润圆到地表达出来。啊，当我听见那暴烈的戴假发的相好把一段热情的台词扯成了破烂，撕得烂碎纷飞，去震裂站池子的听众的耳朵时，他们大多数只赏识莫名其妙的哑剧和哄闹，那时节才要我的命呢：我真愿叫那样个相好挨上一顿鞭子，他把凶神忒蛮冈演得凶过了头；那比暴君赫勒特还暴：请你莫那样做。	SDY
1487	He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm, And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so. At last, a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being. That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn'd He seem'd to find his way without his eyes, For out o' doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me.	他握住我的手腕紧紧不放，拉直了手臂向后退立，用他的另一只手这样遮在他的额角上，一眼不眨地瞧着我的脸，好像要把它临摹下来似的。这样经过了好久的时间，然后他轻轻地摇动一下我的手臂，他的头上上下下地点了三次，于是他发出一声非常惨痛而深长的叹息，好像他的整个的胸部都要爆裂，他的生命就在这一声叹息中间完毕似的。然后他放松了我，转过他的身体，他的头还是向后回顾，好像他不用眼睛的帮助也能够找到他的路，因为直到他走出了门外，他的两眼还是注视在我的身上。	ZSH

We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	我不愿听你的仇家这么说你，也不能让你这般打击我这耳朵，要它相信你对你自己这么样诋毁；我知道你不是懒散的浪子。可是你到埃尔辛诺来做什么？你离开之前我们要教会你酣饮。	SDY

221	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看出你是积极的；你如果对这件事情不采取行动，就比忘川河岸上懒坏的水草还要迟钝了。得，哈姆雷特，听我说。人家宣布说，我在花园里睡觉，一条蛇把我咬了。这一个虚构的死因，恶毒万分，把丹麦全国的听闻一手遮掩了。可是你，高贵的青年，要知道那一条咬死你父亲的毒蛇现在就戴了王冠。怪不得我先恨啊！	BZL

536	We will, my lord. 	是，殿下。	BZL
1358	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的。可是我虽然从小就熟习这种风俗，我却以为把它破坏了倒比遵守它还体面些，这一种酗酒纵乐的风俗，使我们在东西各国受到许多非议；他们称我们为酒徒醉汉，将下流的污名加在我们头上，使我们各项伟大的成就都因此而大为减色。在个人方面也常常是这样，有些人因为身体上长了丑恶的黑痣——这本来是天生的缺陷，不是他们自己的过失——或者生就一种令人侧目的怪癖，虽然他们此外还有许多纯洁优美的品性，可是为了这一个缺点，往往会受到世人的歧视。一点丑恶就毁坏了高贵的品质，使人声名狼藉。	ZSH
1000	I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.	我来告诉你们是为的什么；这样，我先说出来，好免得你们把实情吐露，你们对君王和王后所答应守的秘密可不致脱毛露肉。我近来——但不知为什么缘故——失掉了我所有的一切欢乐，放弃了一切练技的习惯；且当真，我的心情变得如此凄恻，以致这大好的机构，这大地，对我像是垛荒凉的海角；这顶琼绝的华盖，这苍穹，你们看，这赫赫高悬的晴昊，这雕饰着金焰的崇宏的天幕——哎也，这在我看来无非是片龌龊的疫疠横生的水雾集结在一起。人是多么神奇的一件杰作！理性何等高贵！才能何等广大！形容与行止何等精密和惊人！行动，多么像个天使！灵机，多么像个天神！万有的菁英！众生之灵长！可是，对于我，这尘土的精华算得了什么？人，不能叫我欢喜；不，女人也不能，虽然从你这微笑里你似乎在说能。	SDY

Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint. O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. 	安息吧，安息吧，不得安静的灵魂！士子们，以满腔热情我请你们记着我：像哈姆雷特这样个可怜人所能的，为表示他对你们的情意，上帝愿意，准做到。我们进去吧；你们要永远守口如瓶，我请求。这年头乱成了一团：可恨的烦恼，我生不逢辰，命定了要把它整好！来吧，我们一块走。 [同下。	SDY

What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我们也深信无疑：祝两位顺遂。现在，赉候底施，你可有什么事？你曾说有请求；要怎样，赉候底施？你不会对丹麦当今请求得有理，而将话白说；什么事，赉候底施，你有所要求，我不会给你满足？头脑不会跟心儿更加相一致，这只手不会跟这张嘴起到作用，比较丹麦的当今对于你父亲。你有何要求，赉候底施？	SDY
948	That's very true, my lord.	那倒很对，殿下。	SDY
1695	 I shall obey you; And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.	我愿意服从您的意旨。奥菲利娅，但愿你的美貌果然是哈姆雷特疯狂的原因；更愿你的美德能够帮助他恢复原状，使你们两人都能安享尊荣。	ZSH

But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，因为生前孽障未尽，被判在晚间游行地上，白昼忍受火焰的烧灼，必须经过相当的时期，等生前的过失被火焰净化以后，方才可以脱罪。可是我不能违犯禁令，泄露我的狱中的秘密，我可以告诉你一个故事，最轻微的几句话都可以使你魂飞魄散，使你年轻的血液凝冻成冰，使你的双眼像脱了轨道的星球一样向前突出，使你的纠结的鬈发根根分开，像愤怒的豪猪身上的刺毛一样森然耸立；可是这一种永恒的神秘，是不能向血肉的凡耳宣示的，听着，听着，啊，听着！要是你曾经爱过你的亲爱的父亲——	ZSH

Those that are married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. 	我也知道你们会怎样涂脂抹粉；上帝给了你们一张脸，你们又替自己另外造了一张。你们烟行媚视，淫声浪气，替上帝造下的生物乱取名字，卖弄你们不懂事的风骚。算了吧，我再也不敢领教了；它已经使我发了狂。我说，我们以后再不要结什么婚了；已经结过婚的，除了一个人以外，都可以让他们活下去；没有结婚的不准再结婚，进尼姑庵去吧，去。[下]	ZSH

71	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	至亲的先兄哈姆雷特驾崩未久，记忆犹新，大家固然是应当哀戚于心，应该让全国上下愁眉不展，共结成一片哀容，然而理智和感情交战的结果，我们就一边用适当的哀思悼念他。一边也不忘记我们自己的本分。因此，仿佛抱昔中作乐的心情，仿佛一只眼含笑，一只眼流泪，仿佛使殡丧同喜庆歌哭相和，使悲喜成半斤八两，彼此相应，我已同昔日的长嫂，当今的新后，承袭我邦家大业的先王德配，结为夫妇：事先也多方听取了各位的高见，多承一致拥护，一切顺利；为此，特申谢意。如今，各位知道的，小福丁布拉斯，少年气盛，小看了我们的力量，或者妄以为先兄一朝弃世，我们的国家忽然脱了节，脱了榫，单凭了自以为有机可乘的梦想。他就一再送文书前来烦读，要求我们归还他父亲的失地，全不管那些土地是依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的。别再讲他了。现在转回来讲我们这次的会议。事情是这样：我有国书一封写好在此，预备送挪威国王，小福了布拉斯的叔父，他老病经年，卧床不起，并不知悉他侄儿在国内招兵买马，用意何在，因此就请他从速制止他侄儿进一步有所行动。我特此遣派你，考奈留斯，还有你，伏尔第曼德，当这次通问挪威玉国的信使，但是你们和国王进行交涉、不得越权，不得擅自超出了这些训令所明白规定的范围。再见吧！愿速去速回，以表忠诚。考、伏赴汤蹈火，一切定当效命。	BZL

1115	Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,   whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	也不要太瘟了，要让你的得体感教你怎样演：叫姿势配合字句，叫字句配合姿势；特别要谨守这一点，就是你不可超过人天性的中和之道；因为任何东西这么做过了分，便乖离演戏的本意，须知演戏的目的，当初和现在都一样，是要仿佛端着镜子照见人性的真实；使美德显示见它自己的本相，叫丑恶暴露它自己的原形，要时代和世人看到自己的形象和印记。却说做过了头或有所不足，虽然能叫外行人发笑，却不能不使明眼人伤心；这些别具慧眼的人，你们得承认，他的判断要比一戏园其他听众的意见有分量得多呢。啊，我见过有些伶人演戏，还听到人家称赞他们，赞得老高呢，倒不是我形容过分，他们讲话既不像基督教徒的口齿，走路也不像基督教徒、邪教徒，甚至不像人在跨步子，他们那昂头阔步和大声吽叫，使我想起当是造化的雇工造他们出来的，没有造好，所以他们模仿人性弄到这样可恶。	SDY
1436	Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage. Consent to swear.	啊哈！孩儿！你也这样说吗？你在那儿吗，好家伙？来，你们没听见这个地下的人怎么说吗？宣誓吧。	ZSH

But, good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.	我要保持着这篇很好的教训，要它守卫我的心。可是好哥哥，请你莫像那不端的牧师般，指点我登天，去走荆棘塞途的陡峭路，自己却像个浮肿、泼赖的浪荡子，只顾走逍遥嬉耍的莲馨花之道，不管他自己的谆劝。	SDY
467	Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.- Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.	很好：回头我再请你念其余的部分。——大人，请好好找个地方安置这一些伶倌吧。你听见了没有？好好的招待他们：要知道他们是我们时代的缩影和简史。你宁可以死后落到个不体面的墓铭，切不要生前挨他们一场不客气的品评。	BZL

1729	 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.	请你念这段剧词的时候，要照我刚才读给你听的那样子，一个字一个字打舌头上很轻快地吐出来；要是你也像多数的伶人们一样，只会拉开了喉咙嘶叫，那么我宁愿叫那宣布告示的公差念我这几行词句。也不要老是把你的手在空中这么摇挥；一切动作都要温文，因为就是在洪水暴风一样的感情激发之中，你也必须取得一种节制，免得流于过火。啊！我顶不愿意听见一个披着满头假发的家伙在台上乱嚷乱叫，把一段感情片片撕碎，让那些只爱热闹的下层观众听了出神，他们中间的大部分除了欣赏一些莫名其妙的哑剧和喧嚣以外，什么都不懂。我可以把这种家伙抓起来抽一顿鞭子，因为他把妥玛刚特形容过分，希律王的凶暴也要对她甘拜下风	ZSH

754	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	是啊，捕捉傻山鹬的罗网。我知道，当欲火熏蒸的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头滥发盟誓；这些发光焰，女儿，光多于热，一烧亮就熄灭，正在答应时，跟正在烧亮时一样，你切勿把它们当火。从今往后要少露你那闺女的声色于他；将你的会晤要看得比一声传令去面谈更值价。对哈姆雷特殿下，要信任他到这一步，就是他年纪还轻，他可以行动自由的限度比你大得多：干脆说，莪斐丽亚，别信他的盟誓；它们穿针引线，不是它们的衣裳所显示的颜色，而只是追求调情打趣的坏家伙，气息倒像是假装圣洁的臭虔婆，为的是更好欺骗人。归总一句话：讲得简单明了些，从现在开始，我不准你随便糟蹋片刻的闲暇，再去跟哈姆雷特殿下说甚话。要好生注意，关照你：来吧。	SDY

Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d. ‘Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.	代替了原先的冠冕；作为袍服，在她枯瘦的生育过多的腰身裹一条惊惶中随手抓起的毛毯——伤心惨目，谁看了不会含毒水唾骂命运作弄人，万恶不赦？	BZL

182	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	嗯，是的；可是我虽然在这里从小看惯了，却以为这一种风俗，与其遵守它不如破坏它倒来得体面一点。这样的酗酒纵乐使我们受够了东西各国纷纷的议论和低毁；他们叫我们酒鬼，用瘟猪一类话糟蹋了我们的名号：这一种行径也真要抵消了我们的丰功伟业，至少使我们失去了荣誉的精髓了。就个人说来情形也往往如此，有些人品性上有一点小小的暇疵，或者是天生的（那也怪不得他们，因为天性并不能自己作主），或者是由于某一种特殊的气质过分发展到超出了理性的范围，或者是由于养成了一种习惯，过分要一举一动都讨人喜欢，这些人就带了一种缺点的烙印（天然的符号或者是命运的标记），使他们另外的品质（尽管圣桔，尽管多到一个人担当不了，）也就不免在一般的非议中沾染了这个缺点的溃烂症。一点点毛病往往就抵消了一切高贵的品质，害得人声名狼藉。	BZL

807	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我看你容易激发；你要是对这件事情不采取行动，那就比遗忘川夹岸臭烂的莠草更要迟钝了。听我说，哈姆雷特：据他们宣称，我在御花园里睡觉，有条蛇螫了我；全丹麦人的耳朵就误被这个捏造的我的死因卑劣地蒙骗住：可是你，年轻有为，要知道那条螫死你父亲的毒虺现在正戴着王冠。	SDY
1495	Both your Majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.	我们是两位陛下的臣子，两位陛下有什么旨意，尽管命令我们；像这样言重的话，倒使我们置身无地了。	ZSH

All that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.  	好哈姆雷特，摆脱你黑夜的阴沉气，和颜悦色，来面对丹麦王上吧。你不要老是这样子垂下了眼睑，想在黄土中寻找你高贵的父亲。你知道这是很普通的；有生必有死，谁都得通过人世、跨进永恒的。	BZL

334	Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure! But farewell it, for I will use no art.   Mad let us grant him then. And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect- Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause. Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter (have while she is mine), Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.the letter. 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'- That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus:'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'	娘娘，我发誓我一点也不做文章。他已经疯了，是真的；真的是可惜；可惜是真的，多蠢的舞文弄墨！傻话少陪了，因为我不想做文章。我们就承认他疯了吧。下一步就是：我们要找出这种结果的原因，或者不如说这种恶果的原因，因为结果成恶果总有缘故：这是下一步，下一步就是这样。请细思细考。我有个女儿（是我的，我总还“有”她），难为她对我总算孝顺，请注意，给了我这个。请听下文分解。 信手拈来，十分自然，也不背真实。	BZL

I saw him yesterday, or t'other day, Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say, There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; There falling out at tennis'; or perchance, 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now- Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So, by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not	说到“用这样的话对你表示同意”，嗯，对了；他会用这样的话对你表示同意：“我认识这位绅士，昨天我还看见他，或许是前天，或许是什么什么时候，跟什么什么人在一起，正像您所说的，他在什么地方赌钱，在什么地方喝得酩酊大醉，在什么地方因为打网球而跟人家打起架来。”也许他还会说，“我看见他走进什么什么一家生意人家去。”那就是说窑子或是诸如此类的所在。你瞧，你用说谎的钓饵，就可以把事实的真相诱上你的钓钩；我们有智慧、有见识的人，往往用这种旁敲侧击的方法，间接达到我们的目的；你也可以照着我上面所说的那一番话，探听出我的儿子的行为。你懂得我的意思没有？	ZSH

That it should come to this! But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这一个坚实的肉体会融解、消散，化成一堆露水！或者那永生的真神未曾制定禁止自杀的律法！上帝啊！上帝啊！人世间的一切在我看来是多么可厌、陈腐、乏味而无聊！哼！哼！那是一个荒芜不治的花园，长满了恶毒的莠草。想不到居然会有这种事情！刚死了两个月！不，两个月还不满！这样好的一个国王，比起当前这一个来，简直是天神和丑怪；这样爱我的母亲，甚至于不愿让天风吹痛了她的脸。天哪！我必须记着吗？嘿，她会偎倚在他的身旁，好像吃了美味的食物，格外促进了食欲一般；可是，只有一个月的时间，我不能再想下去了！脆弱啊，你的名字就是女人！短短的一个月以前，她哭得像个泪人儿似的，送我那可怜的父亲下葬；她在送葬的时候所穿的那双鞋子现在还没有破旧，她就，她就——上帝啊！一头没有理性的畜生也要悲伤得长久一些——她就嫁给我的叔父，我的父亲的弟弟，可是他一点不像我的父亲，正像我一点不像赫拉克勒斯一样。只有一个月的时间，她那流着虚伪之泪的眼睛还没有消去红肿，她就嫁了人了。啊，罪恶的匆促，这样迫不及待地钻进了乱伦的衾被！那不是好事，也不会有好结果；可是碎了吧，我的心，因为我必须噤住我的嘴！	ZSH

957	Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  	诽谤，卿家：因为这挖苦人的坏蛋在这儿说，老头儿有花白须髯，他们的脸上都是皱纹，眼睛分泌出厚琥珀和梅树脂，头脑里非常缺乏机敏，再加上两条腿十分软弱无力：这一切，卿家，我虽然深信不疑，可是认为这样写下来却不成样子；因为你自己，卿家，会跟我一样年纪，要是你能螃蟹一般往后倒退。朴罗纽司[旁白]这虽是疯癫，说话却有条理。——您可要进里边没风处去吧，殿下？	SDY
1596	Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.	无论什么话都行，只要不是废话。你们是奉命而来的；瞧你们掩饰不了你们良心上的惭愧，已经从你们的脸色上招认出来了。我知道是我们这位好国王和好王后叫你们来的。	ZSH

What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.	我要告诉你们这都是为了什么。这样一来，我有见在先，就免得你们有所泄漏，你们对国王和王后负责的机密就不曾透露了一点风声。我近来——也不知为什么缘故——变成了兴致全无，再不想操练戏乐；我心情如此沉重，直觉得大地这一副大好的框架是伸到茫茫大海里的一座荒凉的山岬，天空这一顶极好的帐幕，你们看，这一片罩在头顶上的豪华的苍穹，这一层镶嵌了金黄色火点子的房顶，啊，我觉得也无非是一大堆结聚在一起的乌烟瘴气。人是多么了不起的一件作品！理性是多么高贵！力量是多么无穷！仪表和举止是多么端整，多么出色！论行动，多么象天使！论了解，多么象天神！宇宙之华！万物之灵！可是，对于我，这点泥土里提炼出来的玩意儿算得了什么呢？人，并不能使我欢喜；不，女人也不行，尽管从你的微笑里，我看出你有相反的意思。	BZL

801	I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的亡魂；判定了在夜间出现一个时期，白天要禁闭在火里断食悔罪，直到我生前所犯罪恶的孽迹都烧光涤净为止。要不是被禁止，不准泄漏我狱中的那些秘密，我能作一番诉叙，它最轻微的话能叫你的灵魂恼杀，热血冻结，使你的眼睛，流星般跳出眶子来，使你那纠结而梳顺的卷须分开，每一根发丝笔立直竖了起来，好像发怒的豪猪身上的针刺。可是这永劫之秘决不能宣泄给血肉的耳朵听。但听啊，呵，听啊！若是你确曾爱过你亲爱的父亲——	SDY

1065	Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!Now I am alone.   O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That, from her working, all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing! No, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha? 'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murther'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion!   Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players Play something like the murther of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be a devil; and the devil hath power T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative than this. The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.	唔，天保佑你们。我现在一个人了。我真是好一个坏蛋，卑鄙的奴才！这可不令人骇怪吗，刚才这伶人，只在虚幻里，在假想的深悲之中，能叫他的灵魂跟意象合而为一，而且发生了作用，脸色恁惨白，两眼噙着泪，神情是一片绝望，音调呜咽，全部的行动跟形相配合着，表达了意象？但一切不为甚！是为海居白！海居白是他什么人，他与她何关，故而要为她哭泣？假使他有了我这动机和怆痛的提示，他会怎么样？他会以泪水将戏台淹没，用骇人的台词震裂听众的耳鼓，使有罪的人疯狂，无罪者惶恐，不知情的人诧骇，简直使一切眼睛和耳朵的机能惊愕无所措。可是我，一条懒虫，一头病偃蹇的瘦鹿，躲在暗角里，白天也做着梦，不记冤仇，不言语，不能替一位君王作主张，他的社稷和至宝的生命都给剥夺而毁灭。我是个懦夫吧？谁叫我坏蛋？斫破我这个脑袋？谁扯掉我这须髯，吹在我脸上？揪我的鼻子？拎着耳朵戳着脸，骂我撒谎无耻？谁对我这样？嗐！该死，我都得吞下去：因为我十足是个胆小鬼，没有一点点仇怨感到被欺侮的苦，否则该早已把这贼奴才的臭肉喂肥了空中所有的臭鸢：血腥的、淫乱的坏蛋！凶残，险诈，奸淫，没人性的恶贼！啊，报仇！哎也，我真是好一头蠢驴！多出色，我啊，亲爱的父亲给人凶杀了，上帝和魔鬼都要我报杀父之仇，而我却窑姐般，用空话啯啯发泄，来一场咒骂，活像个街头的娼妇，一个贱婢！呸呸！转动吧，脑筋啊！嗄，我听说有些犯罪的家伙，坐着在看戏，只因剧中的情节安排得巧妙，就给击中到灵魂的深处，以致立即把他们的罪行招认了出来；为的是凶杀，虽然它没有生舌头、自会用神奇的口舌说话。我要叫伶工们扮演得像我父亲的被杀给我叔父看：我来察看他的神色；我要探到他的痛处：只要他一畏缩，我便知道怎么办。我看见的鬼魂也许是个魔鬼；魔鬼是有能力装成可喜的形状的；不错，也许就趁我精神萎弱心志忧郁时，因他对这样的相好很有威力，骗我去堕入地狱。我得有比这个更确切的原因。这场戏我要靠它，轻易地把这位当今的良心攥住。	SDY

What players are they?	扮演国王的会受到我的欢迎：他这位陛下会受到我的致敬；冒险的骑士可以舞他的剑，使他的盾牌；情人不至于白叹气；阴阳怪气人不至于下不了场；小丑可以叫那些笑机易动、一触即发的家伙笑破了肚皮，女主角可以畅所欲言，即使素体诗白说走了拍子。他们是一班什么戏子？	BZL
1483	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd, No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd, Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle; Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors- he comes before me.	父亲，我正在房间里缝纫的时候，哈姆雷特殿下跑了进来，走到我的面前；他的上身的衣服完全没有扣上纽子，头上也不戴帽子，他的袜子上沾着污泥，没有袜带，一直垂到脚踝上；他的脸色像他的衬衫一样白，他的膝盖互相碰撞，他的神气是那样凄惨，好像他刚从地狱里逃出来，要向人讲述地狱的恐怖一样。	ZSH
668	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好像！不对，的确是；我不懂什么叫“好像”。不光我这件黑外套，好母亲，也不光这身遵礼守制的黑孝衣，也不光这喘息频频的长吁短叹，不，也不仅这眼里的汩汩长流，也不仅面目间沮丧黯淡的神色，和一切形相，表情，悲伤的外观，能真正表白我；这些果真是“好像”，因为它们是一个人表演的姿态：但在我心中有无法表演的哀痛；这些都只是悲哀的服饰和衣裳。	SDY
1399	I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed   That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.	我的话果然激动了你；要是你听见了这种事情而漠然无动于衷，那你除非比疏散在忘河之滨的蔓草还要冥顽不灵。现在，哈姆雷特，听我说；一般人都以为我在花园里睡觉的时候，一条蛇来把我螫死，这一个虚构的死状，把丹麦全国的人都骗过了；可是你要知道，好孩子，那毒害你父亲的蛇，头上戴着王冠呢。	ZSH

Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again. What may this mean   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?	消灾降福的诸天使保佑我们！鬼魂上。不论你是神灵还是妖魔，带来的是天风还是地狱的煞气，不论你的来意是好是坏，你既然带了这样个可疑的形状、我要对你说话。我叫你哈姆雷特、先主，父亲，丹麦王。啊，回答我！别让我问在鼓里，明白告诉我为什么你已经发丧入殓的骸骨挣破了寿衣出来了；为什么坟墓，明明让我们看了你安葬在里面的，重新张开它沉重的大理石巨颚又把你吐出来了。都是为的什么，你这副死尸才重新全副披挂，重新来光顾时隐时现的月色，使黑夜变得狰狞，使我们这样子沦为蠢然的俗物，心惊胆颤，充满了不可思议的恐怖，思虑？说，为什么？干什么？我们该怎么办？（鬼魂招哈姆雷特。	BZL

1345	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	嗯，这些都是捕捉愚蠢的山鹬的圈套。我知道在热情燃烧的时候，一个人无论什么盟誓都会说出口来；这些火焰，女儿，是光多于热的，一下子就会光消焰灭，因为它们本来是虚幻的；你不能把它们当作真火看待。从现在起，你还是少露一些你的女儿家的脸；你应该抬高身价，不要让人家以为你是可以随意呼召的。对于哈姆雷特殿下，你应该这样想，他是个年轻的王子，他比你在行动上有更大的自由。总而言之，奥菲利娅，不要相信他的盟誓，因为它们都是诱人堕落的淫媒，用庄严神圣的辞令，掩饰淫邪险恶的居心。我言尽于此，简单一句话，从现在起，我不许你跟哈姆雷特殿下谈一句话。你留点儿神吧；进去。	ZSH

This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.	嗯，真的；因为美丽可以使贞洁变成淫荡，贞洁却未必能使美丽受它自己的感化；这句话从前像是怪诞之谈，可是现在时间已经把它证实了。我的确曾经爱过你。	ZSH

504	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.   There, my lord.	尊贵的殿下该分明知道是送过的；殿下还附带说过些甜言蜜语使礼物变得更贵重呢。香味变了，东西就收回吧；因为送的人一变心、重礼也变轻，受的人有骨气，不领情。	BZL

655	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然对亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特下世去记忆犹新，我们正该当满心存悲痛，全王国上下如一人，深锁着愁眉，蹙一片广大的哀容，但周详的思虑兀自跟感情作战，于是我们以适度的悲伤想念他，同时也没有遗忘掉我们自己。所以我们仿佛以残败的欢欣——好比一只眼含着笑，一只在流泪，丧礼中有欢乐，喜庆时又唱悼歌，使欣喜和悲苦彼此铢两相称——将我们往日的嫂氏，如今的王后，我们这勇武的宗邦的袭位王嫠，娶为德配；我们在这件事情上并没有排除诸位的高见，且多承自动来赞助：对列公，我们要致谢。现在来讲小福丁勃拉思，这件事各位都知道，他小觑我们的声威，或者认为亲爱的先兄去世后，我们这邦国便变得散乱不成形，加上他自以为有利可图的妄想，他就不断送文书前来相薅恼，一意要我们放弃他父亲的邦土，那失地归我们英勇的王兄所奄有，全经受法律保障。关于他，到这里。现在来谈我们自己和这次会议。事情是这样：我们备好了一封书，给小福丁勃拉思的叔父挪威王，他衰病缠身，卧床不起，不知道他侄儿的谋划，请他把他那侄儿进一步的行动加以制止；为的是那招兵募众，聚草征粮，全部由他治下的臣民负担；我特此派你，考耐列欧斯，还有你，伏尔砥曼特，作专使，送这封文书给挪威老王，可是我授与你们对彼邦君主相应的权限，不得任意超越了这些指示所明白规定的范围。再见，望即速去奉命，以表忠诚。这使命，一切事，我们都忠心赤胆。	SDY

1720	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.	要是你一定要嫁人，我就把这一个诅咒送给你做嫁妆；尽管你像冰一样坚贞，像雪一样纯洁，你还是逃不过谗人的诽谤。进尼姑庵去吧，去；再会！或者要是你必须嫁人的话，就嫁给一个傻瓜吧；因为聪明人都明白你们会叫他们变成怎样的怪物。进尼姑庵去吧，去；越快越好。再会！	ZSH

290	At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry! He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman. I saw him yesterday, or t'other day, Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say, There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; There falling out at tennis'; or perchance, 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now- Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So, by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not	“同意你这样说”——啊，对了，可不是！他就这样说：“我认识这位先生。昨天，或者是前天，或者是另一天，我还看见他同谁、同谁在一起：正如你所说，在什么地方赌钱；喝酒喝醉了；打网球打了架”：或许是“我看见他走进哪一个生意人家”，就是说哪一家窑子，诸如此类。现在你该明白了——你用“假”钓饵钓起了这条“真”鲤鱼，我们这种有深谋远虑的聪明人就这样靠转弯抹角，靠旁敲侧击，善于从间接里达到直接的目标。你也可以照我前面所讲的做法探出我儿子的真相。你懂了没有？	BZL

637	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我能；至少私下里这么样传闻。我们的先王，他那神容只刚才对我们显过形，你们知道，被挪威王福丁勃拉思，野心争胜的狂妄自大煽动他，挑战作决斗；英武的哈姆雷特——我们这半边天下谁对他不钦仰——便斩了福丁勃拉思；凭合同文书，跟法律，也跟纹章院规条很符合，他连同性命，把他所有的土地全部输给了比武决斗的得胜者；跟那份土地正相当，我们的先王押下同样多的地作赌注；这会归福丁勃拉思所有，如果他得胜；就凭契约，以及这条款所规定，前面已说过，哈姆雷特就有了他那片土地。如今小福丁勃拉思，年少气盛火性烈，没经受世故，已经在挪威边境上，这里那里，啸聚了一伙刁悍的亡命之徒，供他们吃喝，要他们去干些行险、侥幸的横心泼胆事；那便不外是——对我们邦国的当政显得很清楚——想用强暴的手段，以动武的态势，从我们这里收回那些他父亲已失去的土地。这个，据我看来，是我们准备频繁的主要因由，我们这警卫的缘故，以及到处急匆匆、纷忙动乱的根本所以然。	SDY

1238	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone   With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting. Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein, in that the levies, The lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subject; and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,   Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King, more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	虽然我们亲爱的王兄哈姆雷特新丧未久，我们的心里应当充满了悲痛，我们全国都应当表示一致的哀悼，可是我们凛于后死者责任的重大，不能不违情逆性，一方面固然要用适度的悲哀纪念他，一方面也要为自身的利害着想；所以，在一种悲喜交集的情绪之下，让幸福和忧郁分据了我的两眼，殡葬的挽歌和结婚的笙乐同时并奏，用盛大的喜乐抵消沉重的不幸，我已经和我旧日的长嫂，当今的王后，这一个多事之国的共同的统治者，结为夫妇；这一次婚姻事先曾经征求各位的意见，多承你们诚意的赞助，这是我必须向大家致谢的。现在我要让你们知道，年轻的福丁布拉斯看轻了我们的实力，也许他以为自从我们亲爱的王兄驾崩以后，我们的国家已经瓦解，所以挟着他的从中取利的梦想，不断向我们书画要求把他的父亲依法割让给我们英勇的王兄的土地归还。这是他一方面的话。现在要讲到我们的态度和今天召集各位来此的目的。我们的对策是这样的：我这儿已经写好了一封信给挪威国王，年轻的福丁布拉斯的叔父，他因为卧病在床，不曾与闻他侄子的企图，在信里我请他注意他的侄子擅自在国内征募壮丁，训练士卒，积极进行各种准备的事实，要求他从速制止他的进一步的行动；现在我就派遣你，考尼律斯，还有你，伏提曼德，替我把这封信送给挪威老王，除了训令上所规定的条件以外，你们不得僭用你们的权力，和挪威成立逾越范围的妥协。你们赶紧就去吧，再会！	ZSH

This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Come.	这就害得他发疯了。可惜我没有正确的注意和判断他的真相。我原先怕他只是想玩弄你，毁你，我的疑心病真该死！真是啊，我们上了一点年纪的总是想得太远了，反而胡涂：正如年轻人往往是太无顾虑、成了胡闹。来，我们去见国王。这等情事一定得明白交代，隐讳了闯祸、还不如讲出来受怪。来。[同下。	BZL

1108	Love? his affections do not that way tend;   Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness.

Haply the seas, and countries different, With variable objects, shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't?	恋爱！他的音响不转往那一方；他说的话儿，虽有点缺乏条理，却不像疯狂。他心里定有什么事，他那阵忧郁像蹲在上边在孵化；我委实疑惧那孵化出来的雏儿将会是一桩危险：为预防那后果，我运用枢机，迅速作出了决断，准定要这样：他应立即往英格兰去催交久未向我们晋献的朝贡：也许漫游了远海和他邦的胜境，纵观各处的山水风物，能排除这仿佛植根于他的心头的郁积，他经常把脑筋在那上头盘旋便使他改变了常态。你以为怎样？	SDY

Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位士子，马帅勒史和剖那陀，一连两个夜晚在他们警卫时，在宵深夜里、死一般冥寂之中，他们碰上了。先王般的一个形象，从头到脚，全副的披挂簇崭齐，在他们面前现形，用庄严的步伐缓慢而威灵地走过他们：他三回走过他们惊骇得欲绝的眼前，跟他们相差不到他一权杖之隔；他们害怕得几乎化成了肉冻，站着像哑巴，不敢对他去开腔。他们把这事惴悚悚秘密告诉我；第三夜我和他们一同去守卫；在那里，正如他们所说的，时间也对，模样也对，每句话都证实，那鬼魂又来了。我认识殿下的父王；这两只手不能更像。	SDY

Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	也不要太平板了；可以拜你们自己酌量行事的见识做自己的导师。用动作配合字句，用字句配合动作；特别要注意一点，你们切不可越出自然的分寸：因为无论哪一点这样子做过了分，就是违背了演剧的目的，该知道演戏的目的，从前也好，现在也好，都是仿佛要给自然照一面镜子；给德行看一看自己的面貌，给荒唐看一看自己的姿态，给时代和社会看一看自己的形象和印记。要是表演得过火了，或者是拖泥带水了，尽管会博得外行人开怀，只能使明眼人痛心：你们把这种行家里面一个人的意见必须估计到重于一院子其他听众的信口雌黄。噢，着实有一些演员，我看过演戏的，也听到别人捧过的，捧上了天的，可真是，说一句倒不是对上帝不敬的话，说起话来不象文明人，走起路来既不象文明人也不象野蛮人，简直不象人，那样的大摇大摆，吼啊叫啊，害得我几乎要相信倒是大自然临时雇来的什么笨工匠造出了人，没有把他们造好，要不然他们何至于模仿人生模仿到这么令人恶心啊！	BZL

That it should come to this! But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two. So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太太结实的肉体（众下，仅留哈姆雷特。融了，解了，化成了一片露水；但愿天经地义并没有一条严禁自杀的戒律！上帝啊！上帝啊！我觉得人世间醉生梦死的一套是多么无聊，乏味，无一是处！呔！呔！这是个荒废的花园，一天天零落；生性芜秽的蔓草全把它占据了。居然有这等事情！才死了两个月！不，还不到两个月。这样好一位国王，比起这一位简直是海庇亮比萨徒；对我的母亲又这样恩爱，简直不容许天风吹痛了她的脸庞。上天下地！定要我记住吗？当日啊，她依他傍他，仿佛是越尝滋味越开了胃口；然而，还不出一个月——我简直不敢想！脆弱啊，你的名字就叫女人！——短短一个月，她象泪人儿一样纷我父亲送葬去穿的鞋子还一点都没有穿旧呢，哎呀，你看她，（无知的畜生也还会哀痛得久一点呢！）她居然就同我的叔父结婚了；我这个叔父可绝不象他的哥哥，正如我不象赫勾列啊！还不出一个月，不等她假仁假义的眼泪干了，不等她热辣的眼睛消去了红肿，她就结婚了。赶急得真是作孽啊，这样轻捷的钻进了乱他的衾被！	BZL

These blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence. Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits,   Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.	捕捉傻鹁鸪的天罗地网！我知道，欲火上升的时候，灵魂会怎样教舌头乱发誓言的。这种火，小丫头，要知道，是光多于热，都不过一现，刚刚发出来，一下子就热退光消了，你千万别当作是真火。从今以后多注意你千金身分，少出头露面吧。你要高高在上，别一听呼召便移樽就教。对于哈姆雷特殿下，你应该明白这一点：他还年轻，而且他可以自由活动的场面比你的广得多。总而言之，莪菲丽亚，别相信他的盟誓；那是牵线人，身上穿的衣裳是洁白，干净，心里转的念头是卑鄙，龊龊，就象龟婆冒充圣徒，假正经，为了更便于骗人。干脆一句话，从今以后，哪怕是片刻的闲工夫我都不准你这样子随便糟蹋、再后来跟哈姆雷特殿下说话！好好留神，我要你记住。来吧。	BZL

768	Ay, marry, is't; But to my mind, though I am native here   And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations; They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So oft it chances in particular men That, for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin,- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-   Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of e'il Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.	是的，凭圣处女：不过在我看来，我虽然在本地生长，日常已见惯，这可是个习俗，遵守它倒不如破坏它更加光荣。这样的酗酒耽乐使我们备受东西诸邦一体的讥讪和责骂；他们叫我们醉鬼，用泥猪那类话玷污我们的称号；那么着也就当真消减了我们丰伟的勋业，把我们声望里的精华、真髓抽去。所以，往往在有些个人身上，因他们本来有某种天生的缺陷，与生俱来，——那可怪不得他们，既然生命不可能自己去选来历——由于某一种性癖有过度的滋长，时常冲破了理性的藩篱与堡砦，或者有什么习惯过于发扬了令人爱的心性形态；却说这些人——他们沾上了那种缺陷的印记，那缺陷，不出于天然，即肇自命运——他们其他的美德，即令清纯得了不起，即令没涘涯，非凡人所能有，将在世人的见解中，因那个缺失而遭到毁伤败坏；一些些乖舛会招致对整个高贵品质的狐疑，使声名狼藉。	SDY

1100	Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.   I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?	你进个修道院去吧：为什么你要孳生孽种？我自己还算是个相当诚实正派的人；可是我能指控自己那么多罪名，我母亲没有生我出来倒要好些：我很骄傲，好报仇，野心大：我随时都能干出想都想不到，捉摸不出模样，来不及实行的一大堆坏事来。像我这样的人爬行于天地之间，所为何来？我们都是些彻底的坏蛋；一个也莫信我们。你去进个修道院吧。你父亲在哪儿？	SDY

1401	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not. Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven, And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once. The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire. Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.	嗯，那个乱伦的奸淫的畜生，他有的是过人的诡诈，天赋的奸恶，凭着他的阴险的手段，诱惑了我的外表上似乎非常贞淑的王后，满足他的无耻的兽欲。啊，哈姆雷特，那是一个多么相去悬殊的差异！我的爱情是那样纯洁真诚，始终信守着我在结婚的时候对她所作的盟誓；她却会对一个天赋的才德远不如我的恶人降心相从！可是正像一个贞洁的女子，虽然淫欲罩上神圣的外表，也不能把她煽动一样，一个淫妇虽然和光明的天使为偶，也会有一天厌倦于天上的唱随之乐，而宁愿搂抱人间的朽骨。可是且慢！我仿佛嗅到了清晨的空气，让我把话说得简短一些，当我按照每天午后的惯例，在花园里睡觉的时候，你的叔父趁我不备，悄悄溜了进来，拿着一个盛着毒草汁的小瓶，把一种使人麻痹的药水注入我的耳腔之内，那药性发作起来，会像水银一样很快地流过全身的大小血管，像酸液滴进牛乳般地把淡薄而健全的血液凝结起来；它一进入我的身体里，我全身光滑的皮肤上便立刻长出无数疱疹，像害着癞病似的满布着可憎的鳞片。这样，我在睡梦之中，被一个兄弟同时夺去了我的生命、我的王冠和我的王后；甚至不给我一个忏罪的机会，使我在没有领到圣餐也没有受过临终涂膏礼时，就一无准备地负着我的全部罪恶去对簿阴曹。可怕啊，可怕！要是你有天性之情，不要默尔而息，不要让丹麦的御寝变成了藏奸养逆的卧榻；可是无论你怎样进行复仇，你的行事必须光明磊落，更不可对你的母亲有什么不利的图谋，她自会受到上天的裁判，和她自己内心中的荆棘的刺戳。现在我必须去了！萤火的微光已经开始暗淡下去，清晨快要到来了；再会，再会！哈姆雷特，记着我。[下]	ZSH
265	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come! Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on),   That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me- this is not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.	那就当稀客来招待，别大惊小怪。你知道夭地间有许多事情，霍拉旭，决不是你们的哲学所梦想得到的。可是来吧！天保佑你们，在这里再发誓一次：不管我举动怎样的离奇古怪，（因为我以后也许要认为应该装出一副疯疯癫癫的样子，）你们看见我这样，千万不要这样子手一叉，或者是这样子头一摇，或者说一句半句的怪言怪语，“嗯，嗯，谁不知道啊！”或者说“愿意说就能说”，或者说“可以说就有人”，说诸如此类闪烁其词的话语，表示你们知道我有什么隐衷：这绝对避免，愿你们沐天恩天惠，发誓吧！	BZL

524	It shall do well. But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia? You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said. We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please; But if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him   To show his grief. Let her be round with him; And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him; or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.	那当然很好。可是我还是相信他这种苦恼的根源，推究起来，到底还是失恋。——怎么样，莪菲丽亚？你不用告诉我们殿下怎么说；我们全听见了。——陛下就那么办吧。 陛下如认为妥当，看戏以后，却不妨让他的母后单独叫他去倾吐心事。请母亲干脆问问他；我愿得陛下许可，躲在一边，听他们密谈。再要是探不出真情，就派他去英国；或者凭陛下的高见，关他在哪一个合适的地方。	BZL

734	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	正是的；因为人身体成长，不光是筋肉和躯干生发；而当这神殿扩张时，心志和神魂所祈求的内心供奉，也跟着增长。他现在也许爱你，现在还没有肮脏和欺骗玷污他清纯的意向：可是，你得要戒惧，考虑到地位，他不能自己做主；因为他要受他自己身份的限制：他不能像无足轻重的人那样，自己定去取，为的是他选得恰当与否决定着全国的安危和兴废；他身居邦国之首，他妃子的征选自应先得到邦国的赞成和听从，经受到约束。那么，他若说他爱你，你该使用聪明去那般听信他，要他由地位规定他采取的行动能履行他所说的话；而这可不出丹麦宗邦整个都赞同的限度外。然后要衡量你那片贞洁将遭受什么样损失，你若太信他的歌声，或是把真心丢给他，漫无羁勒的强求和硬要会打开你童贞的宝藏。要戒惧，莪斐丽亚，要戒惧，亲妹子，你要待在你真正的意向后边，在他情欲的射程与危险之外。那翼翼小心的姑娘已经够放浪，要是她面对着月亮把芳容暴露；玉洁冰清还难逃诽谤的打击；往往在嫩蕊含苞未放的时节，毛虫就已把阳春的娇儿咬伤，当青春对旭照，在朝露泫泫之际，恶毒的风吹雨打最容易摧折它。所以要小心；最安全莫过于戒惧：没有人在旁，青春尚且会自戕。	SDY
94	Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	“好友”——我们换上这一个称呼吧。你可为什么离开了威登堡，霍拉旭？——玛塞勒斯？	BZL

Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, And in part him.'

809	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是的，那个通奸乱伦的禽兽就仗那诡诈的迷功，叛逆的本领——啊，邪恶的聪明和才智，这么样会奸骗！——把我这貌似贞洁的王后，诱得满足了他那无耻的淫欲：啊，哈姆雷特，多自甘的下贱哟！我对她的爱是那么精醇可贵，那和我跟她义结百年姻好时所起的信誓完全相符契，而她竟会委身于这样个伧夫，他对我有什么才智来相比！但正如美德，它永远也不会动心，即令浪荡装扮成天仙来求爱，淫欲，尽管跟光艳的天使结了婚，还会在极乐的天床上感到餍足，而要去贪吃臭烂。且住！我好似闻到了早晨的清气；让我简单说。我在御园里偃息，那是我每天经常的习惯要歇晌，你那叔父偷偷地趁着我不备窜进来，手持一瓶恶毒的紫杉汁，把那引发起全身恶癞的毒精灌进了我的耳孔去；那药性一发就跟人周身的血液水火不相容，只顷刻之间，快得和水银相似，它通行无阻，穿门过路处处到，而且它发作快而猛，像醋酸滴进牛奶，把我的稀薄而健全的血液凝敛冻结了起来：我的血便这样；而且顿时立刻有疹疱散布开，像是大麻风，可恨的呕人的恶癞结满我光滑的全身。便这样，我在睡梦中被一个兄弟一下子把生命、王冠、王后都夺去：就在罪孽深重里一命抛黄泉，来不及接受圣餐，作忏悔，涂油膏，不曾能结算，还戴着满头罪孽，就给赶送到上帝跟前去清账。	SDY
907	Have I, my lord?

511	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.	嗯，真的；因为美丽的力量倒容易把贞洁点化成淫荡，贞洁的力量可难于把美丽改成了象它自己的样子。这本来是一种怪论，可是现在时势却让它得到了证明。我从前的确爱过你。	BZL

What might you think? No, I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. 	但愿我能够证明自己是这样一个人。可是假如我看见这场热烈的恋爱正在进行——不瞒陛下说，我在我的女儿没有告诉我以前，早就看出来了——假如我知道有了这么一回事，却在暗中玉成他们的好事，或者故意视若无睹，假作痴聋，一切不闻不问，那时候陛下的心里觉得怎样？我的好娘娘，您这位王后陛下的心里又觉得怎样？不，我一点儿也不敢懈怠我的责任，立刻就对我那位小姐说：“哈姆雷特殿下是一位王子，不是你可以仰望的；这种事情不能让它继续下去。”于是我把她教训一番，叫她深居简出，不要和他见面，不要接纳他的来使，也不要收受他的礼物；她听了这番话，就照着我的意思实行起来。说来话短，他遭到拒绝以后，心里就郁郁不快，于是饭也吃不下了，觉也睡不着了，他的身体一天憔悴过一天，他的精神一天恍惚过一天，这样一步步发展下去，就变成现在他这一种为我们大家所悲痛的疯狂。	ZSH

1731	Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,   whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	可是太平淡了也不对，你应该接受你自己的常识的指导，把动作和言语互相配合起来；特别要注意到这一点，你不能越过人情的常道；因为不近情理的过分描写，是和演剧的原意相反的，自有戏剧以来，它的目的始终是反映人生，显示善恶的本来面目，给它的时代看一看它自己演变发展的模型。要是表演得过分了或者太懈怠了，虽然可以博外行的观众一笑，明眼之士却要因此而皱眉；你必须看重这样一个卓识者的批评甚于满场观众盲目的毁誉。啊！我曾经看见有几个伶人演戏，而且也听见有人把他们极口捧场，说一句并不过分的话，他们既不会说基督徒的语言，又不会学着人的样子走路，瞧他们在台上大摇大摆，使劲叫喊的样子，我心里就想一定是什么造化的雇工把他们造了下来，造得这样拙劣，以至于全然失去了人类的面目。	ZSH

And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	你还在这里，赉候底施！真羞人，上船，上船！风守在帆篷肩胛上大家在等你。就这么，我为你祝福！还有这几句教训你要去铭记在心头。想到什么不要就说出来，也不要乱想起什么就把事情做。待人要亲切不拘礼，可不得亵狎；旧有的朋友，交情曾经考验过，用钢箍将他们牢牢扣上你灵魂；但莫把每个新结的相识当知交，逢人便款待，手掌起老茧。要当心勿跟人轻易起争吵；但一开了端，便要坚持，使对方得当心对待你。多多听人家说话，少对人开言；多接受意见，自己的判断要保留。衣服讲究得尽你的钱包能负担，但不要花费富俏；要贵重，莫浮夸；一个人的衣着往往标明他品性，他们在法国，身份贵地位高的人特别在那上头最是讲究，最华贵。既不要告贷，也不要借钱给人，借给人往往丢了钱也丢了朋友，而向人借贷会挫钝节约的快口。这句话高过一切：对自己要真实，然后正好比黑夜跟着白昼来，你就不可能对任何旁人不真实。再会：愿我这番话铭记在你心中。	SDY

To die- to sleep- No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep. To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death- The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns- puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,   And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb'red.	活下去还是不活：这是问题。要做到高贵，究竟该忍气吞声来容受狂暴的命运矢石交攻呢，还是该挺身反抗无边的苦恼，扫它个干净？死，就是睡眠——就这样；而如果睡眠就等于了结了心痛以及千百种身体要担受的皮痛肉痛，那该是天大的好事，正求之不得啊！死，就是睡眠；睡眠，也许要做梦，这就麻烦了！我们一旦摆脱了尘世的牵缠，在死的睡眠里还会做些什么梦，一想到就不能不踌躇。这一点顾虑正好使灾难变成了长期的折磨。谁甘心忍受人世的鞭挞和嘲弄，忍受压迫者虐待、傲慢者凌辱，忍受失恋的痛苦、法庭的拖延、衙门的横暴，做埋头苦干的大才、受作威作福的小人一脚踢出去，如果他只消自己来使一下尖刀就可以得到解脱啊？谁甘心挑担子，拖着疲累的生命，呻吟，流汗，要不是怕一死就去了没有人回来的那个从未发现的国土，怕那边还不知会怎样，因此意志动摇了，因此便宁愿忍受目前的灾殃，而不愿投奔另一些未知的昔难？这样子，顾虑使我们都成了懦夫，也就这样子，决断决行的本色蒙上了惨白的一层思虑的病容；本可以轰轰烈烈的大作大为，由于这一点想不通，就出了别扭，失去了行动的名分。啊，别作声！美丽的莪菲丽亚！——女神，你做祷告别忘掉也替我忏悔罪恶。	BZL

1724	Love? his affections do not that way tend;   Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute. Haply the seas, and countries different, With variable objects, shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't?	恋爱！他的精神错乱不像是为了恋爱；他说的话虽然有些颠倒，也不像是疯狂。他有些什么心事盘踞在他的灵魂里，我怕他也许会产生危险的结果。为了防止万一，我已经当机立断，决定一个办法：他必须立刻到英格兰去，向他们追索延宕未纳的贡物；也许他到海外各国游历一趟以后，时时变换的环境，可以替他排解去这一桩使他神思恍惚的心事。你看怎么样？	ZSH

477	Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!Now I am alone.   O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That, from her working, all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing! No, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha? 'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murther'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion!   Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players Play something like the murther of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be a devil; and the devil hath power T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative than this. The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.	好吧，天照顾你们！现在我清静了。啊，我简直是游民，种田的奴才！可真是不可思议啊：看这个戏子无非演一场虚构，做一场苦梦，还能使灵魂都化入了想象的身分，发挥了作用，直弄到脸色都发白了，眼泪都出来了，神情都恍恍惚惚，嗓门都抖抖擞擞，全身的精力都配合意象！而且不为了什么！为了赫古芭？赫古芭对他或者他对赫古芭，有什么值得他哭她呢？他会怎样呢，如果他有了我这种悲愤的缘由？他会让眼泪淹没了整个的舞台，用大声疾呼震裂了听众的耳鼓，处优，好人反而不得善遇。韦立谛及多弗·威尔孙指出莎士比亚借哈姆雷特口说“挨鞭子”，亦有出典，暗讽一五七二年英国政府法令禁止游民及“强项乞丐”（实为被逐出外的无家可归的农民），也包括“不属于本邦任何贵人”的优伶，鞭打是这种惩戒的最经常的法定刑罚。我们也可以注意前面哈姆雷特一再以“乞丐”自况。老人，自己会吃亏的，是出于照顾他们的好意。奴，只是怪他们只知做牛做马，逆来顺受。同时禁令中也包括“乞丐”，哈姆雷特在前面也自比乞丐，可见他站在受压迫的一边。他自己的遭遇也就使他本有的正义感突出了。使一切有罪者发狂，无罪者惊愕，使无知无识者惊慌，真的是吓呆了所有的眼睛和耳朵的全部机能。可是我，一个胡涂蛋，可怜虫，萎靡憔悴，成天做梦，忘记了深仇大恨，不说一句话；全不管哪一位国王叫人家无耻的夺去了一切所有，残害了宝贵的生命！我是个懦夫吗？谁叫我坏蛋，打破我的脑壳，拔下我的胡子来吹我一脸毛？拧我的鼻子，把手指直戳我的脸骂我说谎？谁对我这样的，嗨？活该，我活该忍受！因为我怎样说也总是胆小如鼠，缺少胆汁，不以饱受欺压为苦，要不然我该早就请满天的饿鹰吃饱了狗才的尸肉了。血腥的，荒淫的坏蛋！狠心的，奸诈的，乱伦的，悖理的坏蛋！啊，报仇！咦，我好蠢啊！我这样真算得英勇啊，明知道亲爱的父亲被人家谋杀了，天堂地狱都在唤儿子去报仇，我偏要学下流女人用空话泄气，学泼妇，不知羞耻，大骂起街来，简直象婊子！呸呀呸！开动吧，我的脑筋！我听说曾经有过些犯罪人，正在听戏，因为台上的情景表演得太妙了，一下子打动了灵魂，竟至于当场把他们所犯的罪行招供了出来；因为谋杀案，尽管是没有舌头，也会显说话的神通。我要叫戏班子拿一点类似我父亲遇害的情节演给我叔父看。我要看他的面孔：直探到他的痛痒处。只要他一惊， 身上，显然是司空见惯。	BZL

So excellent a king, that was to this Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on; and yet, within a month- Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;   My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules. Within a month, Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!	啊，但愿这太凝固的肉体会融化，消解，稀释成一滴露水；但愿永恒的主宰没有制定过禁止人自戮的戒律！上帝啊！上帝！这人间一切的常行惯例对于我显得多可厌，陈腐，乏味和无聊！呸呸！啊，这是个芜秽的荒园，丛生着野草；到处是藜蒿与荆蓁，塞地幔天。竟到这样的地步！才死了两个月！不，还不到两月：恁英明一位君主；比起这个来，犹如太阳神比妖仙；他对我母亲这么样亲爱，简直不容许天风吹打上她的脸庞。天公与地母！定要我回想吗？哎也，她偎依着他，仿佛食进得越多，越发加大了胃口；可是，仅仅在一个月之内，莫让我想起——“脆弱”，你名字叫女人！短短一个月，她和那荷琵一个样，涕泪交横，跟着我父亲去送葬穿的鞋还没有穿旧，她呀，就是她——上帝啊！一头全没有理性的畜生也会哀悼得长久些——跟叔父成了婚，我父亲的兄弟，但毫不跟他相像，正如我不像赫勾理斯：一个月之内，不等她佯悲假痛的眼泪停止流，不等她哭痛的眼睛消退红肿，她就结了婚。啊，慌忙得好棘手，迅捷地匆匆引荐于淫乱的床褥！这不是好事，也决不会有好结果：可是，宁肯心碎吧，我必须住口。	SDY

Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack; With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.	他非常恳切，托我们答候陛下。我们一提出，他立即传谕侄儿停止招兵；他原先不明白，还以为这种举动是准备对付波兰人，可是一调查清楚，他就知道确乎是对付陛下的；他大为痛心，怪自己老病无能，竟受人摆布，震怒之下，就发出一道文书把福丁布拉斯召回；年轻人倒服贴，受了挪威王一番申斥，最后在他的叔父面前立下誓言，决不再试图兴兵渎犯陛下。挪威老王因此非常欢喜，赏赐他三千克郎的岁收年金，并且准许他把他已经招募的那些兵士用来对付波兰人；只是有一个请求，写明在这里，（取出文书。希望陛下许他们平安借道，通过陛下的领土出去远征，保证地方秩序，确定路线，都遵照书面的说明。（呈上文书。	BZL

O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.	念这段台词，我请你们，要念得象我念给你们听的那样，轻溜溜的，从舌尖上吐出来。要是你们把它从喉咙里吼出来，象许多演戏的惯常做的那样呢，我倒宁愿叫宣布告示的公差来念我的词句了。也千万不要老是用手把空气劈来劈去，象这样子，而是要用得非常文静；要知道，就是在你们热情横溢的激流当中，雷雨当中，我简直要说是旋风当中，你们也必须争取到拿得出一种节制，好做到珠圆玉润。噢，我深恶痛绝，要我的命也讨厌听一个头戴假发的家伙在台上大叫大嚷，把一股热情撕成了片片，撕得粉碎，拼命去震裂“站场”听众的耳鼓，因为这班人当中大多数是什么也不懂，只赏识莫名其妙的手势戏和热闹。我着实要把这样的家伙抽一顿鞭于才痛快，因为他把泰玛刚特的火性子演过了火。这叫做“演希律，超希律”——火上加油。请你们务必要避免这一点。	BZL
1772	Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.	不，已经四个月了，殿下。	ZSH
636	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来，谁知道就请告诉我，为什么要这样严谨、周密的警卫，使海内的臣民每天都彻夜辛勤；为什么要这样日日去铸造铜炮，且又向外邦去购买刀枪和火药；为什么要这样征用造船的工匠，他们得终周劳苦，礼拜天也不歇；有什么事情会发生，叫人要这么汗流浃背，日夜忙急得没安息：谁能告诉我这件事？	SDY
416	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?	那么，我说到“人，并不能使我欢喜”。你笑什么呢？	BZL
960	You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my life,	你的那个，卿家，我再没有别的东西更愿意给掉的了：除掉我的生命，除了我这生命，除掉我这生命。	SDY
1615	What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession.	什么！是一些童伶吗？谁维持他们的生活？他们的薪工是怎么计算的？他们一到不能唱歌的年龄，就不再继续他们的本行了吗？要是他们攒不了多少钱，长大起来多半还是要做普通戏子的，那时候他们不是要抱怨他们的批评家们从前不该把他们捧得那么高，结果反而妨碍了他们自己的前途吗？	ZSH
908	O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.	啊，把它说出来，我极想知道。	SDY
679	Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you. And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	好朋友，兄台；我跟你换那个称呼。什么事使你离开了威登堡，霍瑞旭？可是马帅勒史？	SDY
1667	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	殿下，我按照他们应得的名分对待他们就是了。	ZSH
837	We have sworn, my lord, already.	我们已发过誓，殿下。	SDY
363	I have, my lord.	有，殿下。	BZL
1096	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.	是啊，当真；因为美丽有力量很快地使贞洁变成个龟鸨，而贞洁却没有力量使美丽变得像它自己一样：这句话从前是个谬论，现在这年头可把它证实了。我确曾爱过你来。	SDY
1325	I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede.	我将要记住你这个很好的教训，让它看守着我的心。可是，我的好哥哥，你不要像有些坏牧师一样，指点我上天去的险峻的荆棘之途，自己却在花街柳巷流连忘返，忘记了自己的箴言。	ZSH
1599	[aside to Guildenstern]	[向吉尔登斯吞旁白]	ZSH
1139	No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.	不，好母亲，这儿有更逗人的活宝。	SDY
369	Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  	胡说八道，先生；这个刻薄鬼在这儿说：老年人长灰白胡子；脸上到处起皱纹；眼睛里排泄出浓浓的琥珀膏和橡胶糊；头脑十足是胡里胡涂，腿棒永远是摇来摆去。这些话，先生，虽然我坚定不移而明明白白的相信是千真万确的，然而我认为这样子写下来实在是不成体统，因为你自己，先生，也会长到我这样年纪的，只要你能象一只螃蟹一样的越走越倒退回去。	BZL
1468	Very good, my lord.	很好，老爷。	ZSH
489	Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.	娘娘，我们在路上恰巧赶上了一个戏班子；我们就对他报告了，他一听说似乎非常高兴。他们现在已经是在这儿宫里了，而且我想已经接受了吩咐，今晚上要给他演戏呢。	BZL
764	Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. What does this mean, my lord?	当真？我没有听见：那么，就快要挨近那鬼魂惯常出现的时刻了。这是什么意思，殿下？	SDY
456	What speech, my good lord?	哪一段呢，殿下？	BZL
1272	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father- methinks I see my father.	这是一举两便的办法，霍拉旭！葬礼中剩下来的残羹冷炙，正好宴请婚筵上的宾客。霍拉旭，我宁愿在天上遇见我最痛恨的仇人，也不愿看到那样的一天！我的父亲，我仿佛看见我的父亲。	ZSH
897	Both your Majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.	两位陛下对我们两人有至高无上的权力，有什么旨意尽可出之以命令，请不用恳请。	SDY
1280	The King my father?	我的父王！	ZSH
1027	My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome-	卿家，我有新闻奉告。罗修斯在罗马演戏的时节——	SDY
75	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?	你父亲答应吗？你说怎样，波乐纽斯？	BZL
666	Ay, madam, it is common.	不错，母亲，很平常。	SDY
977	Prison, my lord?  	坐牢，殿下？	SDY
932	[points to his head and shoulder]	[自指头与肩。]	SDY
57	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;   As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse. And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen. Enter Ghost again. But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again! I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
Spreads his arms. If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and, race to me, Speak to me.   If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which happily foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!	这是搅得乱心眼的一点灰尘。从前，就在全盛时代的罗马，在雄才盖世的恺撒遇害前不久，坟墓都开了，陈死人裹着入殓衣，都出来到罗马街头啾啾的乱叫；天上星拖着火尾巴，露水带血，太阳发黑：向来是控制大海、支配潮汐的月亮，病容满面，昏沉得好象已经到世界末日。劫数临头、大难将至以前，总会先出现种种不祥的征象，如今天上和地上一齐出动，一再把这一类重大变故的预兆对我们国家和人民显示出来了。鬼魂重上。噢，别作声！看！看它又来了！我着邪也要拦住它！别走，影子！只要是你也会开口，也会用舌头的，对我说话吧！莫非你有什么好事要人家来做，好使你安心，也使我行了功德，对我说说！莫非你预先知道祖国的命运，讲出来也许使我们能避免灾殃，说呀！	BZL
1288	Tis very strange.	这很奇怪。	ZSH
815	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.	喂，呵呵，小把戏！来吧，小鸟儿。	SDY
935	You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.	你们知道，有时他在这庑堂里不断地走上四小时。	SDY
243	Why, right! You are in the right! And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part; You, as your business and desires shall point you, For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is; and for my own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.	对呀！你说得对呀！那么，好，用不着再转弯抹角，我认为我们该握握手，各走各的路，你们去照自己意思做自己事情，因为各人有各人的事情和意愿，事实如此；我自己算不了什么，你们看，我要去做祷告。	BZL
533	How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?	怎么样，大人？王上愿意来听这出好戏吗？	BZL
1163	You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play. Pro. For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently.    	您在胡闹，您在胡闹；我要看戏了。我们如今上演这悲剧，先得向诸位把躬来鞠，请海量包涵，耐到终曲。	SDY
1674	Ay, my lord.	可以，殿下。	ZSH
769	Look, my lord, it comes!	看啊，殿下，它来了！	SDY
1105	O heavenly powers, restore him!	啊，天上的众神明，恢复他的灵性！	SDY
434	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th' appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.	二位先生，欢迎你们到艾尔西诺来。握手？好，欢迎总要带礼节。我们就这样子陪你们客气一番吧，免得你们回头计较我接待戏子们的情形（我不妨先对你们说我一定要相当表现一番的），免得你们怪我显得象对他们比诸对你们反而更殷勤。我欢迎你们；可是我的叔父父亲和我的婶娘母亲是弄错了。	BZL
1175	He.	正是。	ZSH
116	Did you not speak to it?	你没有对它说话吗？	BZL
278	And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well. But if't be he I mean, he's very wild Addicted so and so'; and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him- take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty.	不妨说，“也有点认识他，可不太熟悉。要真是我说的那一位，他可胡闹呀，嗜好什么什么”；随便给他捏造些坏话；当然别说得太糟了、以至损害了他的名誉——要注意；可是不妨说一些司空见惯的，一般纨挎子弟向所难免的放浪行为。	BZL
362	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god   kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?	如果太阳在一条死狗身上养得出蛆虫，因为它是一块大可亲吻的臭肉——你有个女儿吗？	BZL
651	So have I heard and do in part believe it. But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up; and by my advice   Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently.	我这么听说过，也有几分信为真。但看啊，晨曦披着赭红的一口钟，在那高高的东山头踩着露水走；我们这警卫散了吧；你们若同意，让我们把今天夜晚所见的东西告诉少哈姆雷特；凭我的性命，这幽灵，对我们哑口，会对他言语。你们可赞成我们把这事对他说，认为情意不可少，责任应当尽？	SDY
694	My lord, the King your father.	见到殿下的父王。	SDY
725	All. Our duty to your honour.  	愿对殿下尽忠。	SDY
1284	But where was this?	可是这是在什么地方？	ZSH
898	But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.	我们两人都遵命，谨在此将自己奉献，愿竭尽全心把我们的忠恳诚挚地置于足下，供驰驱指使。	SDY
793	Mark me.	听我说。	SDY
976	Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?	那就世界末日快到了：可是你们这新闻不对。让我问得更细到些：你们在命运女神手里，好朋友们，该受些什么样遭遇，所以她送你们到这儿来坐牢？	SDY
1302	And fix'd his eyes upon you?	它把眼睛注视着你吗？	ZSH
349	So he does indeed.	他确乎是这样。	BZL
554	No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.	对不住，好母亲，这里有吸引力更大的宝贝。	BZL
1443	Swear by his sword.	宣誓！	ZSH
1253	Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play; But I have that within which passeth show- These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	好像，母亲！不，是这样就是这样，我不知道什么“好像”不“好像”。好妈妈，我的墨黑的外套，礼俗上规定的丧服，勉强吐出来的叹气，像滚滚江流一样的眼泪，悲苦沮丧的脸色，以及一切仪式、外表和忧伤的流露，都不能表示出我的真实的情绪。这些才真是给人瞧的，因为谁都可以做作成这种样子。它们不过是悲哀的装饰和衣服；可是我郁结的心事却无法表现出来的。	ZSH
1164	Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?	这是开场词，还是指环上的诗铭？	SDY
1187	O, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath reliev'd you?	啊！再会，正直的军人！谁替了你？	ZSH
12	Have you had quiet guard?	没有动静吗？	BZL
1324	Think it no more. For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,   And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will; but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth. He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state, And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection,   Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon. Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes. The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	不过如此；因为像新月一样逐渐饱满的人生，不仅是肌肉和体格的成长，而且随着身体的发展，精神和心灵也同时扩大。也许他现在爱你，他的真诚的意志是纯洁而不带欺诈的；可是你必须留心，他有这样高的地位，他的意志并不属于他自己，因为他自己也要被他的血统所支配；他不能像一般庶民一样为自己选择，因为他的决定足以影响到整个国家的安危，他是全身的首脑，他的选择必须得到各部分肢体的同意；所以要是他说，他爱你，你不可贸然相信，应该明白：照他的身份地位来说，他要想把自己的话付诸实现，绝不能越出丹麦国内普遍舆论所同意的范围。你再想一想，要是你用过于轻信的耳朵倾听他的歌曲，让他攫走了你的心，在他的狂妄的渎求之下，打开了你的宝贵的童贞，那时候你的名誉将要蒙受多大的损失。留心，奥菲利娅，留心，我的亲爱的妹妹，不要放纵你的爱情，不要让欲望的利箭把你射中。一个自爱的女郎不应该向月亮显露她的美貌；圣贤也不能逃避谗口的中伤；春天的草木往往还没有吐放它们的蓓蕾，就被蛀虫蠹蚀；朝露一样晶莹的青春，常常会受到罡风的吹打。所以留心吧，戒惧是最安全的方策；即使没有旁人的诱惑，少年的血气也要向他自己叛变。	ZSH
1190	Say- What, is Horatio there ?	喂，——啊！霍拉旭也来了吗？	ZSH
1769	Who, I?	谁，我吗？	ZSH
962	These tedious old fools!	这些个讨厌的老蠢材！	SDY
1740	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.	霍拉旭，你是我所交往的人中最正直的一个。	ZSH
1650	But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'	可是啊！谁看见那蒙脸的王后——	ZSH
1583	We think not so, my lord.	我们倒不这样想，殿下。	ZSH
1159	Belike this show imports the argument of the play.	想来这表演就显示正戏的情节。	SDY
602	O, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath reliev'd you?	啊！再见了，诚实的军人：谁替了你的班？	SDY
142	Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell. Exeunt [all but Hamlet]. My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well. I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.	“尽爱”，我对你们也如此。再见。（众下，仅留哈姆雷特。我父亲灵魂出现，全副武装！一切不妙：我怕这里面有鬼。但愿黑夜早来！且静候分晓：坏事要遮盖，全球上也总是盖不了。（下。	BZL
608	Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.	欢迎，霍瑞旭；欢迎，好马帅勒史。	SDY
1090	Ha, ha! Are you honest?	哈，哈！你贞洁吗？	SDY
1059	Ay, my lord.	能，殿下。	SDY
293	Good my lord! 	谢谢老爷。	BZL
118	Tis very strange.	这真是奇怪。	BZL
280	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing. You may go so far.	对了，喝酒，比剑，赌咒，吵架，搞女人，也都可以说。	BZL
1227	Do, if it will not stand.	好的，要是它不肯站定。	ZSH
133	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  	一定的，一定的。它可是待了很久？	BZL
1457	Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?	很好，很好，好得很。你先给我调查调查有些什么丹麦人在巴黎，他们是干什么的，叫什么名字，有没有钱，住在什么地方，跟哪些人为伍，用度大不大；用这种转弯抹角的方法，要是你打听到他们也认识我的儿子，你就可以更进一步，表示你对他也有相当的认识；你可以这样说：“我知道他的父亲和他的朋友，对他也略为有点认识。”你听见没有，雷纳尔多？	ZSH
1701	Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?	我的好殿下，您这许多天来贵体安好吗？	ZSH
630	How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't?	怎么样，霍瑞旭！您直抖，脸都白了：这可不光是什么幻想了吧？您以为怎么样？	SDY
474	Ay, my lord.	可以，殿下。	BZL
1205	Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.	像得很，它使我心里充满了恐怖和惊奇。	ZSH
944	Not I, my lord.	我不是，殿下。	SDY
1628	My lord, I have news to tell you.	殿下，我有消息要来向您报告。	ZSH
35	In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  	一模一样，正象我们的先王。	BZL
1369	It waves me still. Go on. I'll follow thee.	它还在向我招手。去吧，我跟着你。	ZSH
1120	Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two help to hasten them?	叫伶工们赶快。[朴罗纽司下。你们两位能不能帮着催他们？	SDY
412	[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold not off.	[旁白]得了，你们休想逃过我的眼睛！——你们如果对我还有一分爱意，就不要躲躲闪闪。	BZL
262	[beneath] Swear by his sword.	（自下）发誓！	BZL
8	He.	正是。	BZL
736	Enter Polonius. 	[朴罗纽司上。	SDY
1592	No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?	没有的事，我不愿把你们当作我的仆人一样看待；老实对你们说吧，在我旁边侍候我的人太多啦。可是，凭着我们多年的交情，老实告诉我，你们到艾尔西诺来有什么贵干？	ZSH
1721	O heavenly powers, restore him!	天上的神明啊，让他清醒过来吧！	ZSH
350	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras then. Mark the encounter. If he love her not, And he not from his reason fall'n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state,   But keep a farm and carters.	我趁他这样，把女儿给他放出来；陛下和我就躲到帷幕后边，注意他们的相会，若殿下不爱她，也并不为了恋爱而丧失理性，那就请解除我襄理国家的职务，让我去种田养牲口吧。	BZL
1015	O, there has been much throwing about of brains. Do the boys carry it away?  	啊，委实争吵得激烈。是孩子们赢了吗？	SDY
1148	What is, my lord?	什么，殿下？	SDY
964	[to Polonius] God save you, sir!	[向朴罗纽司]上帝保佑您，老贵卿！	SDY
1074	Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.	娘娘，碰巧我们在路上赶过了一些个演戏的：我们把这告诉他，他听见说起好像显得很高兴：他们现在已经来到了宫里头，而且，我想来，已经奉到了命令今晚上要演给他看。	SDY
877	Observe his inclination in yourself. 	凭你自己的眼光观察他的性癖。	SDY
731	Do you doubt that?	你不信那个吗？	SDY
1066	And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?	你们可能够，经由迂回曲折，得知他为何装出这心神的错乱，用骚嚷而且危险的疯癫闹得他所有的平静日子轧轹不成调？	SDY

Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.	两位先生，欢迎你们到艾尔西诺来。把你们的手给我；按照通行的礼节，我应该向你们表示欢迎。让我不要对你们失礼，因为这些戏子们来了以后，我不能不敷衍他们一番，也许你们见了会发生误会，以为我招待你们还不及招待他们殷勤。我欢迎你们；可是我的叔父父亲和婶母母亲可弄错啦。	ZSH

And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you read, my lord?	您这话什么意思？[旁白]还是老惦念着我女儿：可见他初次见面时不认识我；他说我是个鱼贩子：他的病害得深了，深了：当真，我年轻时节为恋爱也着实遭受过一些磨难；很像他这样。我再来跟他谈谈。您念些什么，殿下？	SDY

And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen.	那是扰乱我们心灵之眼的一点微尘。从前在富强繁盛的罗马，当那雄才大略的尤利乌斯·恺撒驾崩以前不久的时候，披着殓衾的死人都从坟墓里走出来，在街道上啾啾鬼语，拖着火尾、喷着血露的星辰在白昼陨落，支配潮汐的月亮被吞蚀得像一个没有起色的病人；这一类预报重大变故的征兆，在我们国内也已经屡次出现了，可是不要响！瞧！瞧！它又来了！	ZSH

223	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there, From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor   To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be mov'd, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage. But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebona in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilverr it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about,   Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd; Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.	正是那一个通奸乱伦的禽兽，就凭他诡计多端，花样百出，（邪恶的才智啊，这样子有本事诱骗人！）为了满足他极端无耻的兽欲，骗上了我那位最显得贞洁的王后。啊，哈姆雷特，这是怎样的堕落啊，不管我的爱情是这样庄严。完全匹配了我跟她结婚的盟誓，竟至于屈尊就教这一个坏蛋，不看他天赋的才德比我的要低不知多少倍！贞操，尽管让淫欲扮做了天仙前来求爱，也永远不为所动，色情，尽管跟光华的天使结了婚，也会厌弃了至尊极乐的天床吃人家垃圾。慢一点！我好象闻到了早晨的气息；我说得简单些。我在花园里睡觉，我每天午后照例要这样歇一下，想不到你的叔父竟乘我不备，溜进来，用了一小瓶该死的乌木汁，把我的两只耳朵一齐都灌了。这一种麻疯式毒精跟人的血液死不两立，会马上就发作起来，滴溜溜象水银一样，无孔不入，一下子通遍了全身的大门小径，力道猛极了，象酸液滴进了牛奶，一下子把全身鲜活流畅的血液都凝结起来。我的血液就这样了；而且立刻有无数的疹泡，麻疯样，带着可怕的疤片，盖住了我全身光滑的皮肤。我就这样在睡梦中由一个弟兄一下子夺去了生命，王冠，王后！就在罪孽深重里一命归天，来不及举行圣餐礼，忏悔，涂膏，来不及结一结清楚，就叫我算了帐，不管我满头是未清未净的红尘。	BZL

I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me? Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again. What may this mean   That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?	天使保佑我们！不管你是一个善良的灵魂或是万恶的妖魔，不管你带来了天上的和风或是地狱中的罡风，不管你的来意好坏，因为你的形状是这样的和蔼可爱，我要对你说话；我要叫你哈姆雷特，君王，父亲！尊严的丹麦先王，啊，回答我！不要让我在无知的蒙昧里抱恨终天；告诉我为什么你的长眠的骸骨不安窀穸，为什么安葬着你的遗体的坟墓张开它的沉重的大理石的两颚，把你重新吐放出来。你这已死的尸体这样全身甲胄，出现在月光之下，使黑夜变得这样阴森，使我们这些为造化所玩弄的愚人充满了不可思议的恐怖，究竟是什么意思呢？说，这是为了什么？你要我们怎样？[鬼魂向哈姆雷特招手]	ZSH

That done, he lets me go, And with his head over his shoulder turn'd He seem'd to find his way without his eyes, For out o' doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me.	他握住我的手腕，紧紧的，不放开，伸直了手臂尽可能退回去一点，又用另外一只手遮住了眉头，那么样仔细打量我的面容，好象要画它呢。他这样看了许久。临了，轻轻的抖一下我的手臂，他把头这样子上上下下点三次，发出一声怪凄惨沉痛的悲叹，好象这一声震得他全身都碎了，生命都完了。然后他放了我的手，转过身去还朝我转过头来，他似乎不用眼睛只用脚走路，他就这样子一步步走出了房门，始终把目光老盯住在我的身上。	BZL

See you now- Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth; And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out. So, by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not	到“接上你的话这么说”，嗯，对了，凭圣处女；他这样接上：“我认识这位士子；我昨天，前天，或某天还曾看见他，跟这等样人在一起；正如你们说，在那里赌钱，在那里喝醉了酒；在那里打网球跟人吵架”：或许是，“我见他进了这样个生意人家”，就是说，某一家窑子，如此这般。你现在要懂得；把假话作饵，你钓到真话这鲤鱼：我们这些个精明能干的人儿，便使用旁敲侧击的巧计和妙策，迂回曲折地达到了我们的目的：你便可以用我刚才说过的办法，打探我儿子的实况。你懂得没有？	SDY

515	Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.   I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?	你去进尼姑庵吧，你为什么要养出一大堆罪人来呢？我自己是相当洁身自好的；可是我还能指出我的许多罪名，真害得我但愿我的母亲当初还是不要生我出来的好。我非常骄傲，有仇必报，野心勃勃；随时都在转的大逆不道的念头，多得叫我的头脑都装它们不下，叫我的想象力都想不尽它们的形形色色，叫我找不到时间来把它们一一实行哩。象我这种家伙，乱爬在天地之间，有什么事好做呢？我们都是十足的流氓；一个也不要相信我们。你去进尼姑庵吧。你的父亲在哪儿？	BZL

You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	我深信二位的热忱。愿二位珍重！现在，莱阿替斯，你有什么事情呢？你说过有所请求。就说吧，莱阿替斯。丹麦王只要听你说得有理，〔考奈留斯与伏尔弟曼德下。总会答应的。你对我有什么要求还怕不会是未开口先到手，莱阿替斯？丹麦王座对于你的父亲就象头对于心一样的休戚相关，就象手对于嘴一样的乐于效劳。你想要怎样，莱阿替斯？	BZL

1742	Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee,   That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing; A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. Something too much of this I There is a play to-night before the King. One scene of it comes near the circumstance, Which I have told thee, of my father's death.   I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.	不，不要以为我在恭维你；你除了你的善良的精神以外，身无长物，我恭维了你又有什么好处呢？为什么要向穷人恭维？不，让蜜糖一样的嘴唇吮舐愚妄的荣华，在有利可图的所在屈下他们生财有道的膝盖来吧。听着，自从我能够辨别是非，察择贤愚以后，你就是我灵魂里选中的一个人，因为你虽然经历一切的颠沛，却不曾受到一点伤害，命运的虐待和恩宠，你都是受之泰然；能够把感情和理智调整得那么适当，命运不能把他玩弄于股掌之间，那样的人是有福的。给我一个不为感情所奴役的人，我愿意把他珍藏在我的心坎，我的灵魂的深处，正像我对你一样。这些话现在也不必多说了。今晚我们要在国王面前演一出戏，其中有一场的情节跟我告诉过你的我的父亲的死状颇相仿佛；当那幕戏正在串演的时候，我要请你集中你的全副精神，注视我的叔父，要是他在听到了那一段剧词以后，他的隐藏的罪恶还是不露出一丝痕迹来，那么我们所看见的那个鬼魂一定是个恶魔，我的幻想也就像铁匠的砧石那样漆黑一团了。留心看好他；我也要把我的眼睛看定他的脸上；过后我们再把各人观察的结果综合起来，给他下一个判断。	ZSH
374	You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my life,	你放心，我再没有什么比你的“陪”更是一向情愿、巴不得“少”了的──除开我的生命，除开我的生命，除开我的生命。	BZL

I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.

113	Two nights together had these gentlemen (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch In the dead vast and middle of the night Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	最初是：一连两夜，这两位朋友。玛塞勒斯和贝纳陀，出去守夜，就在深沉的半夜里碰见了两次。有一个象殿下父亲一样的人影，自顶至踵十足是全副武装，出现在他们的面前，庄严，威武，慢吞吞大踏步走过去。他连走三遍，贴近他们张口昨舌的面前，近到他伸出统帅棍就可以碰着；害他们骇怕得化成了软瘫的一堆，目瞪口呆，一句话都不敢对它说。他们却极端机密的对我讲了，第三夜我就跟他们一同守夜，完全象他们所讲的，时间也对，样子也对，每句话都证明确实，鬼影又来了。我认识殿下的父亲。手跟手都不能更象了。	BZL

Com'st' thou to' beard me in Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.	啊，天知道，命不好，接下去你就知道是：一朝出了事，糟糕。这支圣经歌的第一段还会给你讲一点故事的；可是看，我给打断了。伶人四五名上。欢迎，欢迎，各位先生；一律欢迎。——我很高兴见到你很好。——欢迎，各位好朋友。——噢，我的老朋友！怎么，你的脸上挂起了黑漆漆一团威武气了，我上次看见你还没有呢。你到丹麦来向我挑战、拿胡子吓我吗？——呵，我的年轻的姑娘，我的小姐！我敢凭圣母起誓，小姐踩了高跟木跷，比我上次看见的时候，更高到顶得着天了。愿上帝保佑你的嗓子，不要哑了，破了，变成了一块不通用的金币，再也叫不响哪。——各位先生，欢迎，欢迎。我们来，学法国的养鹰好手，随便看见什么鸟就把鹰放出去抓；我们马上来一段台词。来，让我们先领略一下你们的技艺。来，来一段热情的台词。	BZL

282	Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency. That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.	决不会，你可以轻描淡写一点儿。你可千万别再进一步糟蹋他，说他是急色儿；这不是我的意思。你得把他的毛病说得挺婉转。使它们显得只是些小不检点，年轻人火气太旺的一时发作，血性方刚的一点儿调皮撒野，只是些常犯的通病。	BZL

1032	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene   individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.	世界上最好的戏子，不拘演悲剧、喜剧、历史剧、牧歌剧、牧歌风喜剧、历史牧歌剧、悲情历史剧、又悲又喜历史牧歌剧、遵守三一律的戏，或是没羁绊的诗剧，无一不能，样样来得：塞尼加的悲剧不嫌太沉重，泊劳德斯的喜剧不怕太轻松。不论照古典法度的，还是洒脱自由的戏，他们都是独一无二的行家。	SDY
633	As thou art to thyself. Such was the very armour he had on When he th' ambitious Norway combated. So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.	正好跟你像你自己一个样：他当年正是披戴着这一身盔甲，对野心的挪威国王单身去决斗；有一次也曾这样怒冲冲，谈判时给激怒，他斫冰上乘橇的波兰王。真是奇怪。	SDY
1130	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air, promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.	绝好，当真；进些石龙子的伙食：我吃的是空气，给空气塞饱了肚子：你也不能这样喂阉鸡吧。	SDY

1514	This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night is night, and time is time. Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.	这件事情总算圆满结束了。王上，娘娘，要是我向你们长篇大论地解释君上的尊严，臣下的名分，白昼何以为白昼，黑夜何以为黑夜，时间何以为时间，那不过徒然浪费了昼、夜、时间；所以，既然简洁是智慧的灵魂，冗长是肤浅的藻饰，我还是把话说得简单一些吧。你们的那位殿下是疯了；我说他疯了，因为假如要说明什么才是真疯，那么除了说他疯了以外，还有什么话好说呢？可是那也不用说了。	ZSH
669	Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father; But you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever   In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd; For what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd, whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father; for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne, And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you. For your intent   In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire; And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	对你父亲这么样居丧而尽孝，哈姆雷特，显示你天性可爱赞；但须知你父亲也曾丧失过父亲，那父亲又曾丧失过他的；未死者理应谨守着孝道，为哀悼而悲痛一个时期；但是去坚持而不舍，固执地伤痛得无休无止，却是种不孝的顽固行径，没男儿气概：那显示一个违背天心的意志，心胸尚未经磨砺，情志太浮躁，智虑过于简单，没经受过修养。因为我们知道那势有所必至，以及理有所固然的寻常事故，为什么我们要任性使气地对抗，牢记在心头？嘿！这触犯了上天，触犯了死者，触犯了造化的法则，对理性极荒谬，揆情度理父亲死乃是寻常事，它从这世上第一回人亡故直到今朝有人死总在叫，“这定得如此”。我们切望你抛弃这种无益的悲伤，将我当作是你的父亲；因为，让举世都知悉，你是我们王位最直接的继承人；最热情的父亲爱他儿子有多么宏隆，我对你的宝爱比起他来绝不会有分毫逊色。至于你要想负笈回到威登堡去继续求学，那对我们的愿望可完全相反；极愿你，改变了心意，在这里留下，在我们和煦的目光眷顾下，温慰中，当我们的重臣，侄儿，当今的世子。	SDY
67	So have I heard and do in part believe it. But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. Break we our watch up; and by my advice   Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? 	我也听说过，也不免有几分相信，可是看，曙光披着褐红色大衣、从那边高高的东山头踏露水来了。我们可以下班了；照我的意思，我们不妨把今晚上看见的情况报告少哈姆雷特；这一个幽灵，对我们哑口，我深信会对他说话的。论情谊，论责任，你们赞成不赞成我们把这件事情报告他一番？	BZL
219	Murther most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.	恶毒的谋杀，谋杀是最恶毒不过的，可是那一下更恶毒，更伤天害理。	BZL
1463	Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency. That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.	不，不，你可以在言语之间说得轻淡一些。你不能说他公然纵欲，那可不是我的意思；可是你要把他的过失讲得那么巧妙，让人家听着好像那不过是行为上的小小的不检，一个血气方刚的少年的一时胡闹，算不了什么。	ZSH
1218	In what particular thought to work I know not; But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	我不知道究竟应该怎样想法；可是大概推测起来，这恐怕预兆着我们国内将要有一番非常的变故。	ZSH
826	Why, right! You are in the right! And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part; You, as your business and desires shall point you, For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is; and for my own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.	对啊；你说得很对；那么，好吧，不必再拘礼多说话，我以为我们可就此握手告别：你们按自己意思做你们的事去；因为各人有各人的意思和事情，事实是如此；至于我可怜的份儿，看我吧，我要去祷告。	SDY
56	I think it be no other but e'en so. Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch, so like the King That was and is the question of these wars.	我想该就是为了这个缘故；这些战争前后都牵涉到先王，怪不得那个鬼影，活象是他，全副武装，走过了我们的岗位。	BZL
472	Ay, my lord.	会，殿下。	BZL
1340	I do not know, my lord, what I should think,	父亲，我不知道我应该怎样想才好。	ZSH

96	I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-   But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	我很高兴看见你。（对贝纳陀）你早啊，你好。——可是你究竟为什么离开了威登堡呢？	BZL
859	Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir, Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?	好，说得好，很好。你得注意，先跟我打听巴黎有哪些丹麦人，他们怎么样过活，跟谁在一起，景况如何，住哪里，跟哪些人交往，开支有多少；这样拐弯抹角探访出他们的确认识我儿子，你要比直接问他们更容易得到我儿子的真相：装出仿佛你只是稍跟他相识；比如，“我认识他父亲和朋友，对他也有点认识”：懂得吗，雷那尔铎？	SDY
1200	Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!	住声！不要说下去；瞧，它又来了！	ZSH

The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.	它引您去到了海里怎么办，殿下，或者去登上可怕的悬崖绝顶，孤悬的岩壁俯瞰着碧深深的海，那里它露出另一副骇人的形相，那也许就会夺去您理智的均衡，使您发疯，那又怎么办？想一下；没有其他的因由，那地方本身就会叫人起浑不顾一切的怪想，只要他俯对那么多噚下的海水，听它在下面呼啸。	SDY

Nay, come, let's go together. 	安息吧，安息吧，不安的灵魂！（二人三度默誓。得，我以满怀的热情信赖二位；只要象哈姆雷特这样的一个可怜人、对你们能表示情谊，托福上天，什么都一定做到。我们进去吧；你们要永远缄口，我请求你们。时代整个儿脱节了；啊，真糟，天生我偏要我把它重新整好！来，我们一块儿走吧。（同下。	BZL

937	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras then. Mark the encounter. If he love her not, And he not from his reason fall'n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state,   But keep a farm and carters.	在这样的时节，我把女儿放出来：陛下和小臣就藏在毡幔后边；请注意他们的相会：他若不爱她，不为了爱她而见得疯癫乱说话，那就叫我再不要来襄赞国政，只顾去种田赶车去。	SDY

1084	To be, or not to be- that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep. To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death- The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns- puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,   And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb'red.	是存在还是消亡，问题的所在；要不要衷心去挨受猖狂的命运横施矢石，更显得心情高贵呢，还是面向汹涌的困扰去搏斗，用对抗把它们了结？死掉；睡去；完结；若说凭一瞑我们便结束了这心头的怆痛和肉体所受千桩自然的冲击，那才真是个该怎样切望而虔求的结局。死掉，睡眠；去睡眠：也许去做梦；唔，那才绝；因为摒弃了这尘世的喧阗之后，在那死亡的睡眠里会做什么梦，使我们踌躇：——顾虑到那个，便把苦难变成了绵延的无尽藏；因为谁甘愿受人世的鞭笞嘲弄，压迫者的欺凌虐待，骄横者的鄙蔑，爱情被贱视，法律迁延不更事，官吏的专横恣肆，以及那耐心而有德之辈所遭受的卑劣者的侮辱，如果他只须用小小一柄匕首将自己结束掉？谁甘愿肩重负，熬着疲累的生涯呻吟而流汗，若不是生怕死后有难期的意外，那未知的杳渺之邦，从它邦土上还不曾有旅客归来，困惑了意志使我们宁愿忍受现有的磨难，不敢投往尚属于未知的劫数？就这样，思虑使我们都成了懦夫，果断力行的天然本色，便这么沾上一层灰苍苍的忧虑的病色，而能令河山震荡的鸿图大业，因这么考虑，洄流误入了歧途，便失去行动的名声。噤口，莫做声！明艳的莪斐丽亚！仙娥，请记住祈祷时替我忏悔。	SDY

But that I am forbid   To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-	我是你父亲的灵魂，判定有一个时期要夜游人世，白天就只能空肚子受火焰燃烧，直到我生前所犯的一切罪孽完全烧净了才罢。我不能犯禁，不能泄漏我狱中的任何秘密，要不然我可以讲讲，轻轻的一句话就会直穿你灵府，冻结你热血，使你的眼睛，象流星，跳出了眶子，使你纠结的发鬈鬈鬈分开，使你每一根发丝丝丝直立，就象发怒的毫猪身上的毛刺。可是这种永劫的神秘决不可透露给血肉的耳朵。听啊，听我说！如果你曾经爱过你亲爱的父亲——	BZL

What, have you given him any hard words of late?	来，跟我一起走。我要去见国王。这正是相思害得他疯头疯脑，谁害上这种狂热病都会得毁自己，任意干起不顾一切的事情，天底下任何种迷人本性的狂热也不过这样厉害。我觉得可惜——你最近对他说过难堪的话吗？	BZL
995	To what end, my lord?	有何目的，殿下？	SDY
1614	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither.	不，他们还是跟从前一样努力；可是，殿下，他们的地位已经被一群羽毛未丰的黄口小儿占夺了去。这些娃娃们的嘶叫博得了台下疯狂的喝彩，他们是目前流行的宠儿，他们的声势压倒了所谓普通的戏班，以至于许多佩剑的绅士，都因为惧怕批评家鹅毛管的威力，而不敢到那边去看戏了。	ZSH

Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,   But better look'd into, he truly found It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd, That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine, Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack; With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.	上禀他覆致最优礼的问候和愿望。我们一晋见，他立即派人去制止他侄儿招兵，那原先对于他像是想要对付波兰人的一些准备；但经过仔细端详，他见到那确乎是针对吾主御座的：对此他伤怀，只因他年老力衰和疾病缠身而被他侄儿所欺罔，便下了敕令给福丁勃拉思；他当即顺从听命；接受了挪威王一番斥责，最后在他的叔父面前立下了誓言，永不再对您陛下陈兵启衅戎。对此，老挪威王表示极度欢忭，颁赐他三千克朗的岁入年金，以及委任他使用这些早先已招募停当的军兵来对付波兰人：有一个请求，另外在此有陈说，[呈上文书。]希望陛下许他们平安假道，通过您邦疆的领土做这番征伐，路过时的安全通行和行军路线则在文书里有开列。	SDY

1219	Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week. What might be toward, that this sweaty haste   Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? Who is't that can inform me?	好吧，坐下来。谁要是知道的，请告诉我，为什么我们要有这样森严的戒备，使全国的军民每夜不得安息；为什么每天都在制造铜炮，还要向国外购买战具；为什么赶造这许多船只，连星期日也不停止工作；这样夜以继日地辛苦忙碌，究竟为了什么？谁能告诉我？	ZSH
1490	That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Come.	这就是使他疯狂的原因。我很后悔看错了人。我以为他不过把你玩弄玩弄，恐怕贻误你的终身；可是我不该这样多疑！正像年轻人干起事来，往往不知道瞻前顾后一样，我们这种上了年纪的人，总是免不了鳃鳃过虑。来，我们见王上去。这种事情是不能蒙蔽起来的，要是隐讳不报，也许会闹出乱子来。来。[同下]	ZSH

1220	That can I. At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full,   Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost; and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch, and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	我可以告诉你，至少一般人都是这样传说。刚才它的形象还像我们出现的那位已故的王上，你们知道，曾经接受骄矜好胜的挪威的福丁布拉斯的挑战；在那一次决斗中间，我们的勇武的哈姆雷特——他的英名是举世称颂的——把福丁布拉斯杀死了；按照双方根据法律的武士精神所订立的协定，福丁布拉斯要是战败了，除了他自己的生命以外，必须把他所有的一切土地拨归胜利的一方；同时我们的王上也是提出相当的土地作为赌注，要是福丁布拉斯得胜了，就归他所有，正像在同一协定上所规定的，他失败了，哈姆雷特可以把他的土地没收一样。现在要说起那位福丁布拉斯的儿子，他生得一副烈火也似的性格，已经在挪威的四境召集了一群无赖之徒，供给他们衣食，驱策他们去干冒险的勾当；他的唯一目的，我们的当局看得很清楚，无非是要用武力和强迫性的条件，夺回他父亲所丧失的土地。照我所知道的，这就是我们种种准备的主要动机，我们这样戒备的唯一原因，也是全国所以这样慌忙骚乱的缘故。	ZSH
1666	Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.- Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.	很好，其余的部分等会儿再念给我听吧。大人，请您去找一处好好的地方安顿这一班伶人。听着，他们是不可怠慢的，因为他们是这一个时代的缩影；宁可在死后得到一首恶劣的墓铭，不要在生前受他们一场刻毒的讥讽。	ZSH
426	What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession.	佩剑的公子哥儿都怕时髦文人的笔杆，不敢再去老地方光顾了。	BZL

523	Love? his affections do not that way tend;   Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute. Haply the seas, and countries different, With variable objects, shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't?	恋爱？他不是朝这面发泄感情的；他说的，虽然有点儿语无伦次，也不象是疯话。他显然另外有心事叫他的忧郁在心头伏窝孵卵；我实在担心孵出来不是别的，是一种危险；为了预防不测，我已经当机立断，下了决心，一定要这么办：立刻打发他去英国，去催收久未向我们缴纳的贡品。出洋过海，跑跑不同的国度，看看新鲜的事物，也许会排除掉这种老是盘据他心头的心事，叫他的脑筋不再老是盘算它，害得他疯头疯脑。你以为怎么样？	BZL

The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.	殿下，它万一把殿下引到了海里，或者把殿下引到了俯瞰海面、峭壁千丈的一个悬崖的顶上，换上了一副面目，狰狞可怕，把殿下吓得丧失了理性的控制，发起疯来，那又怎么样？想想看。无论谁到了这种惊险的地方，看千仞底下那一片海水的汹涌，听海水在底下咆哮，都会无端的起种种极端的怪念哪。	BZL

1700	To be, or not to be- that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep. To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death- The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns- puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,   And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb'red.	生存还是毁灭，这是一个值得考虑的问题；默然忍受命运的暴虐的毒箭，或是挺身反抗人世的无涯的苦难，在奋斗中结束了一切，这两种行为，哪一种是更勇敢的？死了，睡着了，什么都完了；要是在这一种睡眠之中，我们心头的创痛，以及其他无数血肉之躯所不能避免的打击，都可以从此消失，那正是我们求之不得的结局。死了，睡着了；睡着了也许还会做梦；嗯，阻碍就在这儿：因为当我们摆脱了这一具朽腐的皮囊以后，在那死的睡眠里，究竟将要做些什么梦，那不能不使我们踌躇顾虑。人们甘心久困于患难之中，也就是为了这个缘故。谁愿意忍受人世的鞭挞和讥嘲、压迫者的凌辱、傲慢者的冷眼、被轻蔑的爱情的惨痛、法律的迁延、官吏的横暴和费尽辛勤所换来的小人的鄙视，要是他只要用一柄小小的刀子，就可以清算他自己的一生，谁愿意负着这样的重担，在烦劳的生命的迫压下呻吟流汗？倘不是因为惧怕不可知的死后，惧怕那从来不曾有一个旅人回来过的神秘之国，是它迷惑了我们的意志，使我们宁愿忍受目前的折磨，不敢向我们所不知道的痛苦飞去？这样，重重的顾虑使我们全变成了懦夫，决心的赤热的光彩，被审慎的思维盖上了一层灰色，伟大的事业在这一种考虑之下，也会逆流而退，失去了行动的意义。且慢！美丽的奥菲利娅！——女神，在你的祈祷之中，不要忘记替我忏悔我的罪孽。	ZSH
1678	Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!Now I am alone.   O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That, from her working, all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,   And can say nothing! No, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha? 'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murther'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words And fall a-cursing like a very drab, A scullion!   Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players Play something like the murther of my father Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be a devil; and the devil hath power T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds More relative than this. The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.	好，上帝和你们同在！现在我只剩下一个人了。啊，我是一个多么不中用的蠢材！这一个伶人不过在一本虚构的故事，一场激昂的幻梦之中，却能够使他的灵魂融化在他的意象里，在它的影响之下，他的整个的脸色变成惨白，他的眼中洋溢着热泪，他的神情流露着仓皇，他的声音是这么呜咽凄凉，他的全部动作都表现得和他的意象一致，这不是极其不可思议的吗？而且一点也不为了什么！为了赫卡柏！赫卡柏对他有什么相干，他对赫卡柏又有什么相干，他却要为她流泪？要是他也有了像我所有的那样使人痛心的理由，他将要怎样呢？他一定会让眼泪淹没了舞台，用可怖的字句震裂了听众的耳朵，使有罪的人发狂，使无罪的人骇愕，使愚昧无知的人惊慌失措，使所有的耳目迷乱了它们的功能。可是我，一个颟顸的家伙，垂头丧气，一天到晚像在做梦似的，忘记了杀父的大仇；虽然一个国王给人家用万恶的手段掠夺了他的权位，杀害了他的最宝贵的生命，我却始终哼不出一句话来。我是一个懦夫吗？谁骂我恶人？谁敲破我的脑壳？谁拔去我的胡子，把它吹在我的脸上？谁扭我的鼻子？谁当面指斥我胡说？谁对我做这种事？吓！我应该忍受这样的侮辱，因为我是一个没有心肝，逆来顺受的怯汉，否则我早已用这奴才的尸肉，喂肥了四境之内的乌鸢了。嗜血的，荒淫的恶贼！狠心的、奸诈的、淫邪的、悖逆的恶贼！啊！复仇！——嘿，我真是个蠢材！我的亲爱的父亲被人谋杀了，鬼神都在鞭策我复仇，我这做儿子的却像一个下流女人似的，只会用空言发发牢骚，学起泼妇骂街的样子来，在我已经是了不得的了！呸！呸！活动起来吧，我的脑筋！我听人家说，犯罪的人在看戏的时候，因为台上表演的巧妙，有时会激动天良，当场供认他们的罪恶；因为暗杀的事情无论干得怎样秘密，总会借着神奇的喉舌泄露出来。我要叫这班伶人在我的叔父面前表演一本跟我的父亲的惨死情节相仿的戏剧，我就在一旁窥察他的神色；我要探视到他的灵魂的深处，要是他稍露惊骇不安之态，我就知道我应该怎么办。我所看见的幽灵也许是魔鬼的化身，借着一个美好的形状出现，魔鬼是有这一种本领的；对于柔弱忧郁的灵魂，他最容易发挥他的力量；也许他看准了我的柔弱和忧郁，才来向我作祟，要把我引诱到沉沦的路上。我要先得到一些比这更切实的证据；凭着这一本戏，我可以发掘国王内心的隐秘。[下]	ZSH

1283	Two nights together had these gentlemen (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch In the dead vast and middle of the night Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd   Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I knew your father. These hands are not more like.	这两位朋友，马西勒斯和勃那多，在万籁俱寂的午夜守望的时候，曾经连续两夜看见一个自顶至踵全身甲胄，像您父亲一样的人形，在他们的面前出现，用庄严而缓慢的步伐走过他们的身边。在他们惊奇骇愕的眼前，它三次走过去，它手里所握的鞭杖可以碰到他们的身上；他们吓得几乎浑身都瘫痪了，只是呆立着不动，一句话也没有对它说。怀着惴惧的心情，他们把这件事悄悄地告诉了我，我就在第三夜陪着他们一起守望；正像他们所说的一样，那鬼魂又出现了，出现的时间和他的形状，证实了他们的每一个字都是正确的。我认识您的父亲，那鬼魂是那样酷肖他的生前，我这两手也不及他们彼此的相似。	ZSH

These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither.	他们还是照样的发奋，卖力；可是，殿下，如今出现了一案娃儿，这一批毛羽未丰的黄口小儿，在台上尖声怪叫，压倒了别人，博得了台下疯狂的喝采。目前就是数他们时髦；他们把他们所谓的普通戏于糟蹋到这步田地，直叫	BZL

Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. 	十足是正直可敬的忠信之上。	BZL

Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in, Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are most select and generous, chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all- to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!	还在这儿，雷欧提斯！上船去，上船去，真好意思！风息在帆顶上，人家都在等着你哩。好，我为你祝福！还有几句教训，希望你铭刻在记忆之中：不要想到什么就说什么，凡事必须三思而行。对人要和气，可是不要过分狎昵。相知有素的朋友，应该用钢圈箍在你的灵魂上，可是不要对每一个泛泛的新知滥施你的交情。留心避免和人家争吵；可是万一争端已起，就应该让对方知道你不是可以轻侮的。倾听每一个人的意见，可是只对极少数人发表你的意见；接受每一个人的批评，可是保留你自己的判断。尽你的财力购置贵重的衣服，可是不要炫新立异，必须富丽而不浮艳，因为服装往往可以表现人格；法国的名流要人，在这一点上是特别注重的，不要向人告贷，也不要借钱给人；因为债款放了出去，往往不但丢了本钱，而且还失去了朋友；向人告贷的结果，容易养成因循懒惰的习惯。尤其要紧的，你必须对你自己忠实，正像有了白昼才有黑夜一样，对自己忠实，才不会对别人欺诈。再会，愿我的祝福使这一番话在你的行事中奏效！	ZSH

Go   make you ready.	啊！你们必须彻底纠正这一种弊病，还有你们那些扮演小丑的，除了剧本上专为他们写下的台词以外，不要让他们临时编造一些话加上去。往往有许多小丑爱用自己的笑声，引起台下一些无知的观众的哄笑，虽然那时候全场的注意力应当集中于其他更重要的问题上；这种行为是不可恕的，它表示出那丑角的可鄙的野心。去，准备起来吧。	ZSH

Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not; But treasons capital, confess'd and proved, Have overthrown him."	前领主固然还活着，但是他咎由应得，在重判之下，就要丧命。究竟他是勾结了那些挪威人，还是偷偷摸摸，支援了叛贼，还是并用了两手，来颠覆自己的祖国，我还不清楚:但是卖国罪已经供认了，证明了，就把他毁了。	BZL

Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not; But treasons capital, confess'd and proved, Have overthrown him."	原来的考特爵士现在还活着，可是因为他自取其咎，犯了不赦的重罪，在无情的判决之下，将要失去他的生命。他究竟有没有和挪威人公然联合，或者曾经给叛党秘密的援助，或者同时用这两种手段来图谋颠覆他的祖国，我还不能确实知道；可是他的叛国的重罪，已经由他亲口供认，并且有了事实的证明，使他遭到了毁灭的命运。	ZSH

"[Aside.] Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen. [Aside.] This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill, cannot be good.

How now, what news?"	要是干了以后就完了，那么还是快一点干；要是凭着暗杀的手段，可以攫取美满的结果，又可以排除了一切后患；要是这一刀砍下去，就可以完成一切、终结一切、解决一切——在这人世上，仅仅在这人世上，在时间这大海的浅滩上；那么来生我也就顾不到了。可是在这种事情上，我们往往逃不过现世的裁判；我们树立下血的榜样，教会别人杀人，结果反而自己被人所杀；把毒药投入酒杯里的人，结果也会自己饮酖而死，这就是一丝不爽的报应。他到这儿来本有两重的信任：第一，我是他的亲戚，又是他的臣子，按照名分绝对不能干这样的事；第二，我是他的主人，应当保障他身体的安全，怎么可以自己持刀行刺？而且，这个邓肯秉性仁慈，处理国政，从来没有过失，要是把他杀死了，他的生前的美德，将要像天使一般发出喇叭一样清澈的声音，向世人昭告我的弑君重罪；“怜悯”像一个赤身裸体在狂风中飘游的婴儿，又像一个御气而行的天婴，将要把这可憎的行为揭露在每一个人的眼中，使眼泪淹没叹息。没有一种力量可以鞭策我实现自己的意图，可是我的跃跃欲试的野心，却不顾一切地驱着我去冒颠踬的危险。——麦克白夫人上。啊！什么消息？	ZSH
"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly. If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch, With his surcease, success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all -here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgement here, that we but teach Bloody instructions, which being taught return To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips. He's here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murtherer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against The deep damnation of his taking-off, And pity, like a naked new-born babe Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other.  Enter Lady Macbeth.  How now, what news?"	假使做了这件事就算是功成果就，那最好还是赶快做了它；假使暗杀能把那后果羁勒住，不生什么罣碍，一下子把成功抓到手；光这么一击便能在此生中，这时间的沙门滩岸边，停当完功，那我们冒冒身后的风险又何妨？但在这样的情势里，我们总是会遭受到现世的报应；我们那样做只给人以血的教训，榜样一出去便会反过来祸及于创始者自身；无私的公道把我们下毒的酒杯终于会送上我们自己的唇边来。他在此对我寄予了双重的信托：首先，我是他至亲，又是他臣下，都不该有这样的事；其次，我作为东道主，对他的凶手应深闭固拒，更不该自己来操刀。何况，这邓更行使他的权能如此谦和，从政恁贤明有道，他那些美德会像那舌如画角的天使们那样，控诉杀害他、该打入阿鼻地狱的罪恶；而怜悯，像个御风的新生裸体孩婴，或驰骤着无形高飙的小天使，会把这骇人的勾当吹进每个人眼里去，以至泪雨将淹息掉狂风。我没有踢马刺去刺我意志的两侧，而只有跳跃的野心，但跳过了头，会摔倒在那一边。[上。什么事？有什么消息？	SDY
